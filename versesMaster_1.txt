('JDG',  13,  15, 'Manoah said to the angel of TheIAM, "Please, let us detain you, that we may make a young goat ready for you."'),
('JDG',  13,  16, 'The angel of TheIAM said to Manoah, "Though you detain me, I won't eat of your bread; and if you will prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to TheIAM." For Manoah didn't know that he was the angel of TheIAM.'),
('JDG',  13,  17, 'Manoah said to the angel of TheIAM, "What is your name, that when your words happen, we may honor you?"'),
('JDG',  13,  18, 'The angel of TheIAM said to him, "Why do you ask about my name, since it is wonderful?"'),
('JDG',  13,  19, 'So Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to TheIAM: and [the angel] did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.'),
('JDG',  13,  20, 'For it happened, when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar, that the angel of TheIAM ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.'),
('JDG',  13,  21, 'But the angel of TheIAM did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of TheIAM.'),
('JDG',  13,  22, 'Manoah said to his wife, "We shall surely die, because we have seen God."'),
('JDG',  13,  23, 'But his wife said to him, "If TheIAM were pleased to kill us, he wouldn't have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, neither would he have shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these."'),

('JDG',  14,   2, 'He came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, "I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me as wife."'),
('JDG',  14,   3, 'Then his father and his mother said to him, "Is there never a woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?" Samson said to his father, "Get her for me; for she pleases me well."'),
('JDG',  14,   4, 'But his father and his mother didn't know that it was of TheIAM; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.'),

('JDG',  14,   8, 'After a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.'),
('JDG',  14,   9, 'He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave to them, and they ate: but he didn't tell them that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.'),
('JDG',  14,  10, 'His father went down to the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.'),

('JDG',  14,  15, 'on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, "Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Is it not [so]?"'),

('JDG',  14,  17, 'She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it happened on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him severely; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.'),
('JDG',  14,  19, 'The Spirit of TheIAM came mightily on him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and struck thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes [of clothing] to those who declared the riddle. His anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.'),
('JDG',  14,  20, 'But Samson's wife was [given] to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.'),
('JDG',  15,   1, 'But it happened after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a young goat; and he said, "I will go in to my wife into the room." But her father wouldn't allow him to go in.'),

('JDG',  15,  11, 'Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, "Don't you know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?" He said to them, "As they did to me, so have I done to them."'),
('JDG',  15,  12, 'They said to him, "We have come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines." Samson said to them, "Swear to me that you will not fall on me yourselves."'),
('JDG',  15,  13, 'They spoke to him, saying, "No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand; but surely we will not kill you." They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.'),

('JDG',  16,   9, 'Now she had an ambush waiting in the inner room. She said to him, "The Philistines are on you, Samson!" He broke the cords, as a string of tow is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known.'),

('JDG',  16,  14, 'She fastened it with the pin, and said to him, "The Philistines are on you, Samson!" He awakened out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web.'),
('JDG',  16,  16, 'It happened, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was troubled to death.'),
('JDG',  16,  17, 'He told her all his heart, and said to her, "No razor has ever come on my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I will become weak, and be like any other man."'),
('JDG',  16,  18, 'When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, "Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart." Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in their hand.'),
('JDG',  16,  19, 'She made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.'),
('JDG',  16,  20, 'She said, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" He awoke out of his sleep, and said, "I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free." But he didn't know that TheIAM had departed from him.'),

('JDG',  16,  25, 'It happened, when their hearts were merry, that they said, "Call for Samson, that he may entertain us." They called for Samson out of the prison; and he performed before them. They set him between the pillars;'),
('JDG',  16,  26, 'and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, "Allow me to feel the pillars whereupon the house rests, that I may lean on them."'),
('JDG',  16,  28, 'Samson called to TheIAM, and said, "Lord TheIAM, remember me, please, and strengthen me, please, only this once, God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes."'),

('JDG',  16,  30, 'Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people who were therein. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than those who he killed in his life.'),
('JDG',  16,  31, 'Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah his father. He judged Israel twenty years.'),
('JDG',  17,   2, 'He said to his mother, "The eleven hundred [pieces] of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it." His mother said, "Blessed be my son of TheIAM."'),

('JDG',  18,  19, 'They said to him, "Hold your peace, put your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?"'),

('1KI',   7,   2, 'For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was one hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.'),
('1KI',   7,   3, 'It was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams, that were on the pillars; fifteen in a row.'),
('1KI',   7,   4, 'There were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks.'),
('1KI',   7,   5, 'All the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.'),
('1KI',   7,   6, 'He made the porch of pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them.'),
('1KI',   7,   7, 'He made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.'),
('1KI',   7,  12, 'The great court around had three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of TheIAM, and the porch of the house.'),
('1KI',   7,  13, 'King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.'),
('1KI',   7,  14, 'He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. He came to king Solomon, and performed all his work.'),
('1KI',   7,  15, 'For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits encircled either of them about.'),
('1KI',   7,  16, 'He made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.'),
('1KI',   7,  18, 'So he made the pillars; and there were two rows around on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars: and so did he for the other capital.'),
('1KI',   7,  20, 'There were capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows around on the other capital.'),
('1KI',   7,  21, 'He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz.'),
('1KI',   7,  22, 'On the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.'),
('1KI',   7,  23, 'He made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it.'),
('1KI',   7,  24, 'Under its brim around there were buds which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea: the buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast.'),
('1KI',   7,  25, 'It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.'),
('1KI',   7,  26, 'It was a handbreadth thick: and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths.'),
('1KI',   7,  27, 'He made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height.'),
('1KI',   7,  30, 'Every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet of it had supports: beneath the basin were the supports molten, with wreaths at the side of each.'),
('1KI',   7,  31, 'The mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and its mouth was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its mouth were engravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round.'),
('1KI',   7,  32, 'The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.'),
('1KI',   7,  33, 'The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.'),
('1KI',   7,  34, 'There were four supports at the four corners of each base: its supports were of the base itself.'),
('1KI',   7,  35, 'In the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same.'),
('1KI',   7,  36, 'On the plates of its stays, and on its panels, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around.'),
('1KI',   7,  37, 'In this way, he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.'),
('1KI',   7,  38, 'He made ten basins of brass: one basin contained forty baths; and every basin was four cubits; and on every one of the ten bases one basin.'),
('1KI',   7,  39, 'He set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.'),
('1KI',   7,  40, 'Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of TheIAM:'),

('1KI',   7,  44, 'and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;'),
('1KI',   7,  45, 'and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of TheIAM, were of burnished brass.'),
('1KI',   7,  46, 'In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.'),
('1KI',   7,  47, 'Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed], because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out.'),
('1KI',   7,  48, 'Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of TheIAM: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the show bread was, of gold;'),
('1KI',   7,  49, 'and the lampstands, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;'),
('1KI',   7,  50, 'and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple, of gold.'),
('1KI',   7,  51, 'Thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house of TheIAM was finished. Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, [even] the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of TheIAM.'),
('1KI',   8,   1, 'Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' [houses] of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of TheIAM out of the city of David, which is Zion.'),

('2CH',  23,  13, 'and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets; the singers also played musical instruments, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and said, "Treason! treason!"'),
('2CH',  23,  14, 'Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, "Bring her out between the ranks; and whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword." For the priest said, "Don't kill her in the TheIAM's house."'),
('2CH',  23,  16, 'Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be TheIAM's people.'),

('2CH',  24,  11, 'It was so, that whenever the chest was brought to the king's officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the chief priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.'),
('2CH',  24,  12, 'The king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of TheIAM; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of TheIAM, and also such as worked iron and brass to repair the house of TheIAM.'),

('2CH',  25,  12, '[other] ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.'),
('2CH',  25,  13, 'But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth Horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much spoil.'),
('2CH',  25,  14, 'Now it happened, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.'),
('2CH',  25,  15, 'Therefore the anger of TheIAM was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, "Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of your hand?"'),

('2CH',  28,  23, 'For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which struck him; and he said, "Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, so I will sacrifice to them, that they may help me." But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.'),
('2CH',  28,  24, 'Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of TheIAM; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.'),
('2CH',  28,  25, 'In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger TheIAM, the God of his fathers.'),
('2CH',  28,  27, 'Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they didn't bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.'),
('2CH',  29,   1, 'Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.'),
('2CH',  29,   2, 'He did that which was right in the eyes of TheIAM, according to all that David his father had done.'),
('2CH',  29,   3, 'He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of TheIAM, and repaired them.'),
('2CH',  29,   4, 'He brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,'),
('2CH',  29,   5, 'and said to them, "Listen to me, you Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of TheIAM, the God of your fathers, and carry out the filthiness out of the holy place.'),
('2CH',  29,   6, 'For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of TheIAM our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of TheIAM, and turned their backs.'),
('2CH',  29,   7, 'Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.'),
('2CH',  29,   8, 'Therefore the wrath of TheIAM was on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to be tossed back and forth, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as you see with your eyes.'),
('2CH',  29,  10, 'Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with TheIAM, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.'),
('2CH',  29,  11, 'My sons, don't be negligent now; for TheIAM has chosen you to stand before him, to minister to him, and that you should be his ministers, and burn incense."'),
('2CH',  29,  15, 'They gathered their brothers, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of TheIAM, to cleanse the house of TheIAM.'),
('2CH',  29,  16, 'The priests went in to the inner part of the house of TheIAM, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of TheIAM into the court of the house of TheIAM. The Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.'),
('2CH',  29,  17, 'Now they began on the first [day] of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of TheIAM; and they sanctified the house of TheIAM in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.'),
('2CH',  29,  18, 'Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within [the palace], and said, "We have cleansed all the house of TheIAM, and the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels, and the table of show bread, with all its vessels.'),
('2CH',  29,  19, 'Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified; and behold, they are before the altar of TheIAM."'),
('2CH',  29,  20, 'Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of TheIAM.'),
('2CH',  29,  21, 'They brought seven bulls, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven male goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. He commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of TheIAM.'),
('2CH',  29,  22, 'So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the altar.'),
('2CH',  29,  23, 'They brought near the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands on them:'),
('2CH',  29,  24, 'and the priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded [that] the burnt offering and the sin offering [should be made] for all Israel.'),
('2CH',  29,  25, 'He set the Levites in the house of TheIAM with cymbals, with stringed instruments, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of TheIAM by his prophets.'),
('2CH',  29,  26, 'The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.'),
('2CH',  29,  27, 'Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of TheIAM began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel.'),
('2CH',  29,  28, 'All the assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this [continued] until the burnt offering was finished.'),
('2CH',  29,  29, 'When they had made an end of offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped.'),
('2CH',  29,  30, 'Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to TheIAM with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. They sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.'),
('2CH',  29,  31, 'Then Hezekiah answered, "Now you have consecrated yourselves to TheIAM; come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of TheIAM." The assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart [brought] burnt offerings.'),
('2CH',  29,  32, 'The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to TheIAM.'),
('2CH',  29,  34, 'But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: therefore their brothers the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.'),
('2CH',  29,  35, 'Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of TheIAM was set in order.'),
('2CH',  29,  36, 'Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly.'),
('2CH',  30,   1, 'Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of TheIAM at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to TheIAM, the God of Israel.'),
('2CH',  30,   2, 'For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the Passover in the second month.'),
('2CH',  30,   3, 'For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.'),
('2CH',  30,   5, 'So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to TheIAM, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.'),
('2CH',  30,   6, 'So the couriers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, "You children of Israel, turn again to TheIAM, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that have escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.'),
('2CH',  30,   7, 'Don't be like your fathers, and like your brothers, who trespassed against TheIAM, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as you see.'),
('2CH',  30,   8, 'Now don't be stiff-necked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves to TheIAM, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and serve TheIAM your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.'),
('2CH',  30,   9, 'For if you turn again to TheIAM, your brothers and your children shall find compassion before those who led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for TheIAM your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him."'),
('2CH',  30,  10, 'So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun: but they ridiculed them, and mocked them.'),
('2CH',  30,  11, 'Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.'),
('2CH',  30,  12, 'Also on Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of TheIAM.'),
('2CH',  30,  14, 'They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.'),
('2CH',  30,  15, 'Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth [day] of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the house of TheIAM.'),
('2CH',  30,  16, 'They stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood [which they received] of the hand of the Levites.'),
('2CH',  30,  17, 'For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to TheIAM.'),
('2CH',  30,  18, 'For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, "May the good TheIAM pardon everyone'),
('2CH',  30,  19, 'who sets his heart to seek God, TheIAM, the God of his fathers, even if they aren't clean according to the purification of the sanctuary."'),
('2CH',  30,  20, 'TheIAM listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.'),
('2CH',  30,  21, 'The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised TheIAM day by day, [singing] with loud instruments to TheIAM.'),
('2CH',  30,  22, 'Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who had good understanding [in the service] of TheIAM. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings, and making confession to TheIAM, the God of their fathers.'),
('2CH',  30,  23, 'The whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept [other] seven days with gladness.'),
('2CH',  30,  24, 'For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.'),
('2CH',  30,  26, 'So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.'),
('2CH',  30,  27, 'Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.'),
('2CH',  31,   1, 'Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.'),
('2CH',  31,   2, 'Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of TheIAM.'),
('2CH',  31,   3, '[He appointed] also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, [to wit], for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of TheIAM.'),
('2CH',  31,   4, 'Moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of TheIAM.'),
('2CH',  31,   5, 'As soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.'),
('2CH',  31,   6, 'The children of Israel and Judah, who lived in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to TheIAM their God, and laid them by heaps.'),
('2CH',  31,   8, 'When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed TheIAM, and his people Israel.'),
('2CH',  31,   9, 'Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.'),
('2CH',  31,  10, 'Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, "Since people began to bring the offerings into the house of TheIAM, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty: for TheIAM has blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store."'),
('2CH',  31,  11, 'Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of TheIAM; and they prepared them.'),
('2CH',  31,  12, 'They brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second.'),
('2CH',  31,  13, 'Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.'),
('2CH',  31,  14, 'Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east [gate], was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the offerings of TheIAM, and the most holy things.'),
('2CH',  31,  15, 'Under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brothers by divisions, as well to the great as to the small:'),
('2CH',  31,  16, 'besides those who were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone who entered into the house of TheIAM, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their divisions;'),
('2CH',  31,  17, 'and those who were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers' houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their divisions;'),
('2CH',  31,  18, 'and those who were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.'),
('2CH',  31,  19, 'Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all who were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.'),
('2CH',  31,  20, 'Hezekiah did so throughout all Judah; and he worked that which was good and right and faithful before TheIAM his God.'),
('2CH',  31,  21, 'In every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.'),
('2CH',  32,   1, 'After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.'),
('2CH',  32,   2, 'When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,'),
('2CH',  32,   3, 'he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city; and they helped him.'),
('2CH',  32,   4, 'So many people gathered together, and they stopped all the springs, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, "Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?"'),
('2CH',  32,   5, 'He took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised [it] up to the towers, and the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo [in] the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.'),
('2CH',  32,   6, 'He set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spoke comfortably to them, saying,'),

('2CH',  32,  15, 'Now therefore don't let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this way, neither believe him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand?"'),
('2CH',  32,  16, 'His servants spoke yet more against TheIAM God, and against his servant Hezekiah.'),
('2CH',  32,  17, 'He also wrote letters insulting TheIAM, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, "As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver his people out of my hand."'),

('2CH',  32,  19, 'They spoke of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's hands.'),
('2CH',  32,  20, 'Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.'),
('2CH',  32,  21, 'TheIAM sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. When he had come into the house of his god, those who came forth from his own bowels killed him there with the sword.'),
('2CH',  32,  22, 'Thus TheIAM saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all [others], and guided them on every side.'),
('2CH',  32,  23, 'Many brought gifts to TheIAM to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.'),
('2CH',  32,  24, 'In those days Hezekiah was sick even to death: and he prayed to TheIAM; and he spoke to him, and gave him a sign.'),
('2CH',  32,  25, 'But Hezekiah didn't render again according to the benefit done to him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath on him, and on Judah and Jerusalem.'),
('2CH',  32,  26, 'Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of TheIAM didn't come on them in the days of Hezekiah.'),
('2CH',  32,  27, 'Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all kinds of goodly vessels;'),
('2CH',  32,  28, 'storehouses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all kinds of animals, and flocks in folds.'),
('2CH',  32,  29, 'Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance.'),
('2CH',  32,  30, 'This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. Hezekiah prospered in all his works.'),
('2CH',  32,  31, 'However in [the business of] the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.'),
('2CH',  32,  33, 'Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. Manasseh his son reigned in his place.'),
('2CH',  33,   1, 'Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.'),
('2CH',  33,   2, 'He did that which was evil in the sight of TheIAM, after the abominations of the nations whom TheIAM cast out before the children of Israel.'),
('2CH',  33,   3, 'For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baals, and made Asheroth, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them.'),
('2CH',  33,   4, 'He built altars in the house of TheIAM, of which TheIAM said, "My name shall be in Jerusalem forever."'),
('2CH',  33,   5, 'He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of TheIAM.'),
('2CH',  33,   6, 'He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom. He practiced sorcery, divination, and witchcraft, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits and with wizards. He did much evil in the sight of TheIAM, to provoke him to anger.'),
('2CH',  33,   7, 'He set the engraved image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, "In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever:'),

('2CH',  33,  10, 'TheIAM spoke to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.'),
('2CH',  33,  11, 'Therefore TheIAM brought on them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.'),
('2CH',  33,  12, 'When he was in distress, he begged TheIAM his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.'),
('2CH',  33,  13, 'He prayed to him; and he was entreated by him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that TheIAM was God.'),
('2CH',  33,  14, 'Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he encircled Ophel [with it], and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.'),
('2CH',  33,  15, 'He took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of TheIAM, and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of TheIAM, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.'),
('2CH',  33,  16, 'He built up the altar of TheIAM, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve TheIAM, the God of Israel.'),
('2CH',  33,  17, 'Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only to TheIAM their God.'),
('2CH',  33,  18, 'Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of TheIAM, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.'),
('2CH',  33,  19, 'His prayer also, and how [God] was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the engraved images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.'),
('2CH',  33,  20, 'So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his place.'),
('2CH',  33,  22, 'He did that which was evil in the sight of TheIAM, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.'),
('2CH',  33,  23, 'He didn't humble himself before TheIAM, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.'),
('2CH',  34,   1, 'Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.'),
('2CH',  34,   2, 'He did that which was right in the eyes of TheIAM, and walked in the ways of David his father, and didn't turn aside to the right hand or to the left.'),

('EZR',   8,  22, 'For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken to the king, saying, "The hand of our God is on all those who seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all those who forsake him."'),
('EZR',   8,  23, 'So we fasted and begged our God for this: and he was entreated of us.'),

('EZR',   8,  35, 'The children of the captivity, who had come out of exile, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering to TheIAM.'),
('EZR',   8,  36, 'They delivered the king's commissions to the king's satraps, and to the governors beyond the River: and they furthered the people and the house of God.'),
('EZR',   9,   1, 'Now when these things were done, the princes drew near to me, saying, "The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, [doing] according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.'),
('EZR',   9,   3, 'When I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.'),
('EZR',   9,   4, 'Then were assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of them of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening offering.'),
('EZR',   9,   5, 'At the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn; and I fell on my knees, and spread out my hands to TheIAM my God;'),
('EZR',   9,   6, 'and I said, "My God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you, my God; for our iniquities have increased over our head, and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens.'),

('EZR',   9,  15, 'TheIAM, the God of Israel, you are righteous; for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as it is this day. Behold, we are before you in our guiltiness; for none can stand before you because of this."'),
('EZR',  10,   1, 'Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together to him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very bitterly.'),

('JER',  19,  11, 'and shall tell them, Thus says TheIAM of Armies: Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel, that can't be made whole again; and they shall bury in Topheth, until there be no place to bury.'),
('JER',  19,  12, 'Thus will I do to this place, says TheIAM, and to its inhabitants, even making this city as Topheth:'),
('JER',  19,  13, 'and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, shall be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the army of the sky, and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.'),
('JER',  19,  14, 'Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, where TheIAM had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of TheIAM's house, and said to all the people:'),

('JER',  31,  35, 'Thus says TheIAM, who gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar; TheIAM of Armies is his name:'),
('JER',  31,  36, 'If these ordinances depart from before me, says TheIAM, then the offspring of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me forever.'),

('JER',  32,   1, 'The word that came to Jeremiah from TheIAM in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.'),
('JER',  32,   2, 'Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah's house.'),
('JER',  32,   3, 'For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy, and say, Thus says TheIAM, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;'),
('JER',  32,   4, 'and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes;'),

Then I knew that this was the word of TheIAM.'),
('JER',  32,  10, 'I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.'),
('JER',  32,  12, 'and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses who subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.'),
('JER',  32,  13, 'I commanded Baruch before them, saying,'),

('JER',  36,  21, 'So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king.'),
('JER',  36,  22, 'Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month: and [there was a fire in] the brazier burning before him.'),
('JER',  36,  23, 'It happened, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that [the king] cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.'),
('JER',  36,  24, 'They were not afraid, nor tore their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words.'),
('JER',  36,  25, 'Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not hear them.'),
('JER',  36,  26, 'The king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but TheIAM hid them.'),
('JER',  36,  27, 'Then the word of TheIAM came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,'),
('JER',  36,  28, 'Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.'),
('JER',  36,  29, 'Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, Thus says TheIAM: You have burned this scroll, saying, Why have you written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from there man and animal?'),
('JER',  36,  30, 'Therefore thus says TheIAM concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit on the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.'),
('JER',  36,  31, 'I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn't listen.'),
('JER',  36,  32, 'Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides to them many like words.'),
('JER',  37,   2, 'But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did listen to the words of TheIAM, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.'),
('JER',  37,   3, 'Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to TheIAM our God for us.'),
('JER',  37,   5, 'Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they broke up from Jerusalem.'),
('JER',  37,   6, 'Then came the word of TheIAM to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,'),
('JER',  37,   7, 'Thus says TheIAM, the God of Israel, You shall tell the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.'),
('JER',  37,   8, 'The Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire.'),
('JER',  37,   9, 'Thus says TheIAM, Don't deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us; for they shall not depart.'),
('JER',  37,  10, 'For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yes would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.'),
('JER',  37,  11, 'that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,'),
('JER',  37,  12, 'then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of the people.'),
('JER',  37,  13, 'When he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You are falling away to the Chaldeans.'),
('JER',  37,  14, 'Then Jeremiah said, It is false; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he didn't listen to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.'),
('JER',  37,  16, 'When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;'),
('JER',  37,  17, 'Then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from TheIAM? Jeremiah said, There is. He said also, You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.'),
('JER',  37,  18, 'Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?'),
('JER',  37,  19, 'Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?'),
('JER',  37,  20, 'Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.'),
('JER',  37,  21, 'Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard; and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.'),
('JER',  38,   2, 'Thus says TheIAM, He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey, and he shall live.'),
('JER',  38,   3, 'Thus says TheIAM, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.'),
('JER',  38,   4, 'Then the princes said to the king, "Please let this man be put to death; because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man doesn't seek the welfare of this people, but the hurt."'),
('JER',  38,   5, 'Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he who can do anything against you.'),
('JER',  38,   6, 'Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king's son, that was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.'),
('JER',  38,   7, 'Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),'),
('JER',  38,   8, 'Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying,'),
('JER',  38,   9, 'My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.'),
('JER',  38,  10, 'Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from here thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies.'),
('JER',  38,  11, 'So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.'),
('JER',  38,  12, 'Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords. Jeremiah did so.'),
('JER',  38,  13, 'So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.'),

('JER',  38,  15, 'Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? and if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.'),
('JER',  38,  16, 'So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As TheIAM lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.'),
('JER',  38,  17, 'Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, Thus says TheIAM, the God of Armies, the God of Israel: If you will go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and you shall live, and your house.'),
('JER',  38,  18, 'But if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand.'),

('JER',  39,   4, 'that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.'),
('JER',  39,   5, 'But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment on him.'),

('JER',  41,   5, 'that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of TheIAM.'),
('JER',  41,   6, 'Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it happened, as he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.'),
('JER',  41,   7, 'It was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, [and cast them] into the midst of the pit, he, and the men who were with him.'),
('JER',  41,   8, 'But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, Don't kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he stopped, and didn't kill them among their brothers.'),
('JER',  41,   9, 'Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was who which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed.'),

('EZE',   4,   4, 'Moreover lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; [according to] the number of the days that you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.'),
('EZE',   4,   5, 'For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days, even three hundred ninety days: so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.'),
('EZE',   4,   6, 'Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it to you.'),
('EZE',   4,   8, 'Behold, I lay bands on you, and you shall not turn you from one side to the other, until you have accomplished the days of your siege.'),
('EZE',   4,   9, 'Take for yourself also wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make bread of it; [according to] the number of the days that you shall lie on your side, even three hundred ninety days, you shall eat of it.'),
('EZE',   4,  10, 'Your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time you shall eat it.'),
('EZE',   4,  11, 'You shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time you shall drink.'),
('EZE',   4,  12, 'You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man.'),
('EZE',   4,  13, 'TheIAM said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.'),
('EZE',   4,  14, 'Then I said, Ah Lord TheIAM! behold, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth up even until now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn of animals; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.'),
('EZE',   4,  15, 'Then he said to me, Behold, I have given you cow's dung for man's dung, and you shall prepare your bread thereon.'),
('EZE',   4,  16, 'Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and in dismay:'),
('EZE',   4,  17, 'that they may want bread and water, and be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.'),
('EZE',   5,   1, 'You, son of man, take a sharp sword; You shall take it as a barber's razor to you, and shall cause it to pass on your head and on your beard: then take balances to weigh, and divide the hair.'),
('EZE',   5,   2, 'A third part you shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and you shall take a third part, and strike with the sword around it; and a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.'),
('EZE',   5,   3, 'You shall take of it a few in number, and bind them in your skirts.'),
('EZE',   5,   4, 'Of these again you shall take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; from it shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.'),
('EZE',   5,   5, 'Thus says the Lord TheIAM: This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are around her.'),
('EZE',   5,   6, 'She has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her; for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.'),
('EZE',   5,   7, 'Therefore thus says the Lord TheIAM: Because you are turbulent more than the nations that are around you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my ordinances, neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you;'),
('EZE',   5,   8, 'therefore thus says the Lord TheIAM: Behold, I, even I, am against you; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations.'),
('EZE',   5,   9, 'I will do in you that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all your abominations.'),

('EZE',   5,  11, 'Therefore, as I live, says the Lord TheIAM, surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your abominations, therefore will I also diminish [you]; neither shall my eye spare, and I also will have no pity.'),
('EZE',   5,  12, 'A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of you; and a third part shall fall by the sword around you; and a third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.'),
('EZE',   5,  13, 'Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I shall be comforted; and they shall know that I, TheIAM, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath on them.'),
('EZE',   5,  14, 'Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are around you, in the sight of all that pass by.'),
('EZE',   5,  15, 'So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, to the nations that are around you, when I shall execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes; (I, TheIAM, have spoken it;)'),
('EZE',   5,  16, 'when I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine, that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine on you, and will break your staff of bread;'),
('EZE',   5,  17, 'and I will send on you famine and evil animals, and they shall bereave you; and pestilence and blood shall pass through you; and I will bring the sword on you: I, TheIAM, have spoken it.'),
('EZE',   6,   1, 'The word of TheIAM came to me, saying,'),
('EZE',   6,   2, 'Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy to them,'),
('EZE',   6,   3, 'and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord TheIAM: Thus says the Lord TheIAM to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places.'),
('EZE',   6,   4, 'Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense altars shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.'),
('EZE',   6,   5, 'I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones around your altars.'),
('EZE',   6,   6, 'In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.'),
('EZE',   6,   7, 'The slain shall fall in the midst of you, and you shall know that I am TheIAM.'),
('EZE',   6,   8, 'Yet will I leave a remnant, in that you shall have some that escape the sword among the nations, when you shall be scattered through the countries.'),
('EZE',   6,   9, 'Those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations where they shall be carried captive, how that I have been broken with their lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the prostitute after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.'),
('EZE',   6,  10, 'They shall know that I am TheIAM: I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.'),
('EZE',   6,  11, 'Thus says the Lord TheIAM: Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.'),
('EZE',   6,  12, 'He who is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he who is near shall fall by the sword; and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my wrath on them.'),
('EZE',   6,  13, 'You shall know that I am TheIAM, when their slain men shall be among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered pleasant aroma to all their idols.'),
('EZE',   6,  14, 'I will stretch out my hand on them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations: and they shall know that I am TheIAM.'),
('EZE',   7,   1, 'Moreover the word of TheIAM came to me, saying,'),
('EZE',   7,   2, 'You, son of man, thus says the Lord TheIAM to the land of Israel, An end: the end is come on the four corners of the land.'),

('EZE',   7,   4, 'My eye shall not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your ways on you, and your abominations shall be in the midst of you: and you shall know that I am TheIAM.'),
('EZE',   7,   5, 'Thus says the Lord TheIAM: An evil, an only evil; behold, it comes.'),
('EZE',   7,   6, 'An end has come, the end has come; it awakes against you; behold, it comes.'),
('EZE',   7,   7, 'Your doom has come to you, inhabitant of the land: the time has come, the day is near, [a day of] tumult, and not [of] joyful shouting, on the mountains.'),
('EZE',   7,   8, 'Now will I shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my anger against you, and will judge you according to your ways; and I will bring on you all your abominations.'),
('EZE',   7,   9, 'My eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring on you according to your ways; and your abominations shall be in the midst of you; and you shall know that I, TheIAM, do strike.'),
('EZE',   7,  10, 'Behold, the day, behold, it comes: your doom is gone forth; the rod has blossomed, pride has budded.'),
('EZE',   7,  11, 'Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them [shall remain], nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither shall there be eminency among them.'),
('EZE',   7,  12, 'The time is come, the day draws near: don't let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is on all its multitude.'),
('EZE',   7,  13, 'For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude of it, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.'),
('EZE',   7,  14, 'They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goes to the battle; for my wrath is on all its multitude.'),
('EZE',   7,  15, 'The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine within: he who is in the field shall die with the sword: and he who is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.'),

('EZE',   7,  19, 'They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of TheIAM: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity.'),
('EZE',   7,  20, 'As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations [and] their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it to them as an unclean thing.'),
('EZE',   7,  21, 'I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.'),
('EZE',   7,  22, 'My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret [place]; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.'),
('EZE',   7,  23, 'Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.'),
('EZE',   7,  24, 'Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.'),
('EZE',   7,  25, 'Destruction comes; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.'),
('EZE',   7,  26, 'Mischief shall come on mischief, and rumor shall be on rumor; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.'),
('EZE',   7,  27, 'The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do to them after their way, and according to their own judgments will I judge them; and they shall know that I am TheIAM.'),
('EZE',   8,   1, 'in the sixth year, in the sixth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord TheIAM fell there on me.'),
('EZE',   8,   3, 'He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the sky, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner [court] that looks toward the north; where there was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.'),
('EZE',   8,   4, 'Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.'),
('EZE',   8,   5, 'Then he said to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and see, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.'),
('EZE',   8,   6, 'He said to me, Son of man, do you see what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But you shall again see yet other great abominations.'),
('EZE',   8,   8, 'Then he said to me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had dug in the wall, behold, a door.'),
('EZE',   8,   9, 'He said to me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.'),
('EZE',   8,  10, 'So I went in and saw; and see, every form of creeping things, and abominable animals, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed around on the wall.'),
('EZE',   8,  11, 'There stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel; and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up.'),
('EZE',   8,  12, 'Then he said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his rooms of imagery? for they say, TheIAM doesn't see us; TheIAM has forsaken the land.'),
('EZE',   8,  13, 'He said also to me, You shall again see yet other great abominations which they do.'),
('EZE',   8,  14, 'Then he brought me to the door of the gate of TheIAM's house which was toward the north; and see, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz.'),
('EZE',   8,  15, 'Then he said to me, Have you seen [this], son of man? You shall again see yet greater abominations than these.'),
('EZE',   8,  16, 'He brought me into the inner court of TheIAM's house; and see, at the door of the temple of TheIAM, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs toward the temple of TheIAM, and their faces toward the east; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east.'),
('EZE',   8,  17, 'Then he said to me, Have you seen [this], son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger: and behold, they put the branch to their nose.'),
('EZE',   8,  18, 'Therefore will I also deal in wrath; my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.'),
('EZE',   9,   1, 'Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.'),
('EZE',   9,   2, 'Behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side. They went in, and stood beside the bronze altar.'),
('EZE',   9,   3, 'The glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer's inkhorn by his side.'),
('EZE',   9,   4, 'TheIAM said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in its midst.'),
('EZE',   9,   5, 'To the others he said in my hearing, Go through the city after him, and strike: don't let your eye spare, neither have pity;'),
('EZE',   9,   6, 'kill utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but don't come near any man on whom is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men that were before the house.'),
('EZE',   9,   7, 'He said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go forth! They went forth, and struck in the city.'),
('EZE',   9,   8, 'It happened, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell on my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord TheIAM! will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem?'),
('EZE',   9,   9, 'Then he said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perversion: for they say, TheIAM has forsaken the land, and TheIAM doesn't see.'),
('EZE',   9,  10, 'As for me also, my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way on their head.'),
('EZE',   9,  11, 'Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as you have commanded me.'),
('EZE',  10,   2, 'He spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling [wheels], even under the cherub, and fill both your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. He went in as I watched.'),
('EZE',  10,   4, 'The glory of TheIAM mounted up from the cherub, [and stood] over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of TheIAM's glory.'),
('EZE',  10,   5, 'The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.'),
('EZE',  10,   6, 'It came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.'),
('EZE',  10,   7, 'The cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took [of it], and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.'),
('EZE',  10,   8, 'There appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings.'),
('EZE',  10,   9, 'I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.'),
('EZE',  10,  11, 'When they went, they went in their four directions: they didn't turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it; they didn't turn as they went.'),
('EZE',  10,  12, 'Their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes all around, [even] the wheels that the four of them had.'),
('EZE',  10,  13, 'As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, the whirling [wheels].'),
('EZE',  10,  14, 'Every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.'),
('EZE',  10,  15, 'The cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.'),
('EZE',  10,  17, 'When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.'),
('EZE',  10,  18, 'The glory of TheIAM went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.'),
('EZE',  10,  19, 'The cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of TheIAM's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.'),
('EZE',  10,  20, 'This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.'),
('EZE',  10,  21, 'Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.'),
('EZE',  10,  22, 'As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.'),
('EZE',  11,   1, 'Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of TheIAM's house, which looks eastward: and see, at the door of the gate twenty-five men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.'),
('EZE',  11,   2, 'He said to me, Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city;'),

('EZE',  12,   4, 'You shall bring forth your stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for moving; and you shall go forth yourself at even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.'),
('EZE',  12,   6, 'In their sight you shall bear it on your shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; you shall cover your face, so that you don't see the land: for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel.'),
('EZE',  12,   7, 'I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the even I dug through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bore it on my shoulder in their sight.'),
('EZE',  12,   8, 'In the morning came the word of TheIAM to me, saying,'),

('EZE',  17,  22, 'Thus says the Lord TheIAM: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain:'),
('EZE',  17,  23, 'in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing; in the shade of its branches shall they dwell.'),
('EZE',  17,  24, 'All the trees of the field shall know that I, TheIAM, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish; I, TheIAM, have spoken and have done it.'),
('EZE',  18,   1, 'The word of TheIAM came to me again, saying,'),
('EZE',  18,   2, 'What do you mean, that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?'),
('EZE',  18,   3, 'As I live, says the Lord TheIAM, you shall not have [occasion] any more to use this proverb in Israel.'),
('EZE',  18,   4, 'Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul who sins, he shall die.'),
('EZE',  18,   5, 'But if a man is just, and does that which is lawful and right,'),
('EZE',  18,   6, 'and has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has defiled his neighbor's wife, neither has come near to a woman in her impurity,'),
('EZE',  18,   8, 'he who has not given forth on interest, neither has taken any increase, who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has executed true justice between man and man,'),
('EZE',  18,   9, 'has walked in my statutes, and has kept my ordinances, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, says the Lord TheIAM.'),
('EZE',  18,  10, 'If he fathers a son who is a robber, a shedder of blood, and who does any one of these things,'),
('EZE',  18,  11, 'and who does not any of those [duties], but even has eaten on the mountains, and defiled his neighbor's wife,'),
('EZE',  18,  13, 'has given forth on interest, and has taken increase; shall he then live? he shall not live: he has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be on him.'),
('EZE',  18,  14, 'Now, behold, if he fathers a son, who sees all his father's sins, which he has done, and fears, and does not such like;'),
('EZE',  18,  15, 'who has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, has not defiled his neighbor's wife,'),
('EZE',  18,  16, 'neither has wronged any, has not taken anything to pledge, neither has taken by robbery, but has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;'),
('EZE',  18,  17, 'who has withdrawn his hand from the poor, who has not received interest nor increase, has executed my ordinances, has walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.'),
('EZE',  18,  18, 'As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity.'),
('EZE',  18,  19, 'Yet you say, Why doesn't the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.'),
('EZE',  18,  20, 'The soul who sins, he shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be on him.'),
('EZE',  18,  21, 'But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.'),

('EZE',  18,  24, 'But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live?

('EZE',  18,  25, 'Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, house of Israel: Is my way not equal? Aren't your ways unequal?'),
('EZE',  18,  26, 'When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies therein; in his iniquity that he has done shall he die.'),
('EZE',  18,  27, 'Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.'),
('EZE',  18,  28, 'Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.'),
('EZE',  18,  29, 'Yet says the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. house of Israel, are not my ways equal? Aren't your ways unequal?'),
('EZE',  18,  30, 'Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, everyone according to his ways, says the Lord TheIAM. Return, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.'),
('EZE',  18,  32, 'For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies, says the Lord TheIAM: therefore turn yourselves, and live.'),
('EZE',  19,   1, 'Moreover, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,'),
('EZE',  19,   2, 'and say, What was your mother? A lioness: she couched among lions, in the midst of the young lions she nourished her cubs.'),
('EZE',  19,   3, 'She brought up one of her cubs: he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.'),
('EZE',  19,   4, 'The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.'),
('EZE',  19,   5, 'Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her cubs, and made him a young lion.'),
('EZE',  19,   6, 'He went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.'),
('EZE',  19,   7, 'He knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and its fullness, because of the noise of his roaring.'),
('EZE',  19,   8, 'Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.'),
('EZE',  19,   9, 'They put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into strongholds, that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel.'),
('EZE',  19,  10, 'Your mother was like a vine, in your blood, planted by the waters: it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.'),
('EZE',  19,  11, 'It had strong rods for the scepters of those who bore rule, and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs, and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches.'),
('EZE',  19,  12, 'But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit: its strong rods were broken off and withered; the fire consumed them.'),
('EZE',  19,  14, 'Fire is gone out of the rods of its branches, it has devoured its fruit, so that there is in it no strong rod to be a scepter to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.'),
('EZE',  20,   1, 'in the seventh year, in the fifth [month], the tenth [day] of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of TheIAM, and sat before me.'),
('EZE',  20,   2, 'The word of TheIAM came to me, saying,'),
('EZE',  20,   3, 'Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and tell them, Thus says the Lord TheIAM: Is it to inquire of me that you have come? As I live, says the Lord TheIAM, I will not be inquired of by you.'),
('EZE',  20,   4, 'Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers;'),
('EZE',  20,   5, 'and tell them, Thus says the Lord TheIAM: In the day when I chose Israel, and swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, I am TheIAM your God;'),
('EZE',  20,   6, 'in that day I swore to them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.'),
('EZE',  20,   7, 'I said to them, Cast away every man the abominations of his eyes, and don't defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am TheIAM your God.'),
('EZE',  20,   8, 'But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me; they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.'),
('EZE',  20,   9, 'But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.'),
('EZE',  20,  10, 'So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.'),
('EZE',  20,  11, 'I gave them my statutes, and showed them my ordinances, which if a man does, he shall live in them.'),

('EZE',  20,  13, 'But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they didn't walk in my statutes, and they rejected my ordinances, which if a man keep, he shall live in them; and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them in the wilderness, to consume them.'),
('EZE',  20,  16, 'because they rejected my ordinances, and didn't walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.'),
('EZE',  20,  17, 'Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I didn't destroy them, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.'),
('EZE',  20,  18, 'I said to their children in the wilderness, Don't walk in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.'),
('EZE',  20,  19, 'I am TheIAM your God: walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them;'),
('EZE',  20,  20, 'and make my Sabbaths holy; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am TheIAM your God.'),
('EZE',  20,  21, 'But the children rebelled against me; they didn't walk in my statutes, neither kept my ordinances to do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them; they profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.'),
('EZE',  20,  22, 'Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.'),
('EZE',  20,  25, 'Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they should not live;'),
('EZE',  20,  26, 'and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through [the fire] all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am TheIAM.'),
('EZE',  20,  27, 'Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them, Thus says the Lord TheIAM: In this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.'),
('EZE',  20,  28, 'For when I had brought them into the land, which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there also they made their pleasant aroma, and they poured out there their drink offerings.'),
('EZE',  20,  29, 'Then I said to them, What does the high place where you go mean? So its name is called Bamah to this day.'),
('EZE',  20,  30, 'Therefore tell the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord TheIAM: Do you pollute yourselves in the way of your fathers? and do you play the prostitute after their abominations?'),
('EZE',  20,  31, 'and when you offer your gifts, when you make your sons to pass through the fire, do you pollute yourselves with all your idols to this day? and shall I be inquired of by you, house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord TheIAM, I will not be inquired of by you;'),

('EZE',  20,  34, 'and I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries in which you are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out;'),
('EZE',  20,  35, 'and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face.'),
('EZE',  20,  36, 'Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you, says the Lord TheIAM.'),
('EZE',  20,  37, 'I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;'),
('EZE',  20,  38, 'and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and those who disobey against me; I will bring them forth out of the land where they live, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and you shall know that I am TheIAM.'),
('EZE',  20,  39, 'As for you, house of Israel, thus says the Lord TheIAM: Go, serve everyone his idols, and hereafter also, if you will not listen to me; but my holy name you shall no more profane with your gifts, and with your idols.'),
('EZE',  20,  40, 'For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, says the Lord TheIAM, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them, serve me in the land: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first fruits of your offerings, with all your holy things.'),

('EZE',  20,  47, 'and tell the forest of the South, Hear the word of TheIAM: Thus says the Lord TheIAM, Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned thereby.'),
('EZE',  20,  48, 'All flesh shall see that I, TheIAM, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.'),

('EZE',  21,   4, 'Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:'),
('EZE',  21,   5, 'and all flesh shall know that I, TheIAM, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.'),
('EZE',  21,   6, 'Sigh therefore, you son of man; with the breaking of your thighs and with bitterness you will sigh before their eyes.'),
('EZE',  21,   7, 'It shall be, when they tell you, Why do you sigh? that you shall say, Because of the news, for it comes; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the Lord TheIAM.'),
('EZE',  21,   8, 'The word of TheIAM came to me, saying,'),

('EZE',  21,  10, 'it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? the rod of my son, it condemns every tree.'),
('EZE',  21,  11, 'It is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yes, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the killer.'),
('EZE',  21,  12, 'Cry and wail, son of man; for it is on my people, it is on all the princes of Israel: they are delivered over to the sword with my people; strike therefore on your thigh.'),
('EZE',  21,  13, 'For there is a trial; and what if even the rod that condemns shall be no more? says the Lord TheIAM.'),
('EZE',  21,  14, 'You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike your hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one who is deadly wounded, which enters into their rooms.'),
('EZE',  21,  15, 'I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter.'),
('EZE',  21,  16, 'Gather yourselves together, go to the right, set yourselves in array, go to the left, wherever your face is set.'),
('EZE',  21,  17, 'I will also strike my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest: I, TheIAM, have spoken it.'),

('EZE',  21,  21, 'For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the arrows back and forth, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver.'),
('EZE',  21,  22, 'In his right hand was the divination [for] Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.'),
('EZE',  21,  23, 'It shall be to them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings iniquity to memory, that they may be taken.'),
('EZE',  21,  24, 'Therefore thus says the Lord TheIAM: Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear; because you have come to memory, you shall be taken with the hand.'),

('EZE',  23,   2, 'Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:'),
('EZE',  23,   3, 'and they played the prostitute in Egypt; they played the prostitute in their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there was handled the bosom of their virginity.'),
('EZE',  23,   4, 'The names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.'),
('EZE',  23,   5, 'Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians [her] neighbors,'),
('EZE',  23,   7, 'She bestowed her prostitution on them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself.'),
('EZE',  23,   8, 'Neither has she left her prostitution since [the days of] Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity; and they poured out their prostitution on her.'),
('EZE',  23,   9, 'Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, on whom she doted.'),
('EZE',  23,  10, 'These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters; and her they killed with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they executed judgments on her.'),
('EZE',  23,  11, 'Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her prostitution which were more than the prostitution of her sister.'),
('EZE',  23,  12, 'She doted on the Assyrians, governors and rulers, [her] neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.'),
('EZE',  23,  13, 'I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way.'),

('EZE',  23,  17, 'The Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.'),
('EZE',  23,  18, 'So she uncovered her prostitution, and uncovered her nakedness: then my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul was alienated from her sister.'),
('EZE',  23,  20, 'She doted on their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.'),
('EZE',  23,  21, 'Thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth, in the handling of your bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of your youth.'),
('EZE',  23,  22, 'Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord TheIAM: Behold, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side:'),
('EZE',  23,  23, 'the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, [and] all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, princes and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.'),
('EZE',  23,  24, 'They shall come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples; they shall set themselves against you with buckler and shield and helmet all around; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.'),
('EZE',  23,  25, 'I will set my jealousy against you, and they shall deal with you in fury; they shall take away your nose and your ears; and your residue shall fall by the sword: they shall take your sons and your daughters; and your residue shall be devoured by the fire.'),
('EZE',  23,  26, 'They shall also strip you of your clothes, and take away your beautiful jewels.'),
('EZE',  23,  27, 'Thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you, and your prostitution [brought] from the land of Egypt; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.'),

('EZE',  23,  29, 'and they shall deal with you in hatred, and shall take away all your labor, and shall leave you naked and bare; and the nakedness of your prostitution shall be uncovered, both your lewdness and your prostitution.'),
('EZE',  23,  30, 'These things shall be done to you, because you have played the prostitute after the nations, and because you are polluted with their idols.'),
('EZE',  23,  31, 'You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I give her cup into your hand.'),
('EZE',  23,  32, 'Thus says the Lord TheIAM: You will drink of your sister's cup, which is deep and large; you will be ridiculed and held in derision; it contains much.'),
('EZE',  23,  33, 'You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria.'),
('EZE',  23,  34, 'You shall even drink it and drain it out, and you shall gnaw the broken pieces of it, and shall tear your breasts; for I have spoken it, says the Lord TheIAM.'),
('EZE',  23,  35, 'Therefore thus says the Lord TheIAM: Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore you also bear your lewdness and your prostitution.'),
('EZE',  23,  36, 'TheIAM said moreover to me: Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? then declare to them their abominations.'),
('EZE',  23,  37, 'For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols have they committed adultery; and they have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through [the fire] to them to be devoured.'),
('EZE',  23,  39, 'For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and behold, thus have they done in the midst of my house.'),
('EZE',  23,  40, 'Furthermore you have sent for men who come from far, to whom a messenger was sent, and behold, they came; for whom you did wash yourself, paint your eyes, and decorate yourself with ornaments,'),
('EZE',  23,  41, 'and sit on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon you set my incense and my oil.'),
('EZE',  23,  42, 'The voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on the hands of them [twain], and beautiful crowns on their heads.'),
('EZE',  23,  43, 'Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, Now will they play the prostitute with her, and she [with them].'),
('EZE',  23,  44, 'They went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute: so went they in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.'),
('EZE',  23,  45, 'Righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women who shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.'),
('EZE',  23,  46, 'For thus says the Lord TheIAM: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed back and forth and robbed.'),
('EZE',  23,  47, 'The company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.'),
('EZE',  23,  48, 'Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.'),
('EZE',  23,  49, 'They shall recompense your lewdness on you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols; and you shall know that I am the Lord TheIAM.'),
('EZE',  24,   1, 'Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, the word of TheIAM came to me, saying,'),
('EZE',  24,   2, 'Son of man, write the name of the day, [even] of this same day: the king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day.'),
('EZE',  24,   3, 'Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and tell them, Thus says the Lord TheIAM, Set on the caldron, set it on, and also pour water into it:'),
('EZE',  24,   4, 'gather its pieces into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.'),
('EZE',  24,   5, 'Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile [of wood] for the bones under [the caldron]; make it boil well; yes, let its bones be boiled in its midst.'),
('EZE',  24,   6, 'Therefore thus says the Lord TheIAM: Woe to the bloody city, to the caldron whose rust is therein, and whose rust is not gone out of it! take out of it piece after piece; No lot is fallen on it.'),
('EZE',  24,   7, 'For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it on the bare rock; she didn't pour it on the ground, to cover it with dust.'),
('EZE',  24,   8, 'That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood on the bare rock, that it should not be covered.'),
('EZE',  24,   9, 'Therefore thus says the Lord TheIAM: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.'),
('EZE',  24,  10, 'Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh, and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned.'),
('EZE',  24,  11, 'Then set it empty on its coals, that it may be hot, and its brass may burn, and that its filthiness may be molten in it, that its rust may be consumed.'),
('EZE',  24,  12, 'She has wearied [herself] with toil; yet her great rust doesn't go forth out of her; her rust doesn't [go forth] by fire.'),
('EZE',  24,  13, 'In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have cleansed you and you weren't cleansed, you shall not be cleansed from your filthiness any more, until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest.'),
('EZE',  24,  14, 'I, TheIAM, have spoken it: it shall happen, and I will do it: I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to your ways, and according to your doings, shall they judge you, says the Lord TheIAM.'),
('EZE',  24,  15, 'Also the word of TheIAM came to me, saying,'),
('EZE',  24,  16, 'Son of man, behold, I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down.'),
('EZE',  24,  17, 'Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead; bind your headdress on you, and put your shoes on your feet, and don't cover your lips, and don't eat men's bread.'),
('EZE',  24,  18, 'So I spoke to the people in the morning; and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.'),
('EZE',  24,  19, 'The people said to me, Won't you tell us what these things are to us, that you do so?'),

('EZE',  41,  18, 'It was made with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;'),
('EZE',  41,  19, 'so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. [thus was it] made through all the house all around:'),
('EZE',  41,  20, 'from the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made: thus was the wall of the temple.'),
('EZE',  41,  21, 'As for the temple, the door posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance [of it] was as the appearance [of the temple].'),
('EZE',  41,  22, 'The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and its corners, and its length, and its walls, were of wood: and he said to me, This is the table that is before TheIAM.'),
('EZE',  41,  24, 'The doors had two leaves [apiece], two turning leaves: two [leaves] for the one door, and two leaves for the other.'),
('EZE',  41,  25, 'There were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like as were made on the walls; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside.'),
('EZE',  41,  26, 'There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side rooms of the house, and the thresholds.'),
('EZE',  42,   1, 'Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the room that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north.'),

('EZE',  42,   3, 'Over against the twenty [cubits] which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story.'),
('EZE',  42,   4, 'Before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits' breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.'),
('EZE',  42,   6, 'For they were in three stories, and they didn't have pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore [the uppermost] was straitened more than the lowest and the middle from the ground.'),
('EZE',  42,   8, 'For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and behold, before the temple were one hundred cubits.'),
('EZE',  42,  11, 'The way before them was like the appearance of [the way of] the rooms which were toward the north; according to their length so was their breadth: and all their exits were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.'),
('EZE',  42,  13, 'Then he said to me, The north rooms and the south rooms, which are before the separate place, they are the holy rooms, where the priests who are near to TheIAM shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meal offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.'),
('EZE',  42,  14, 'When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments in which they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertains to the people.'),
('EZE',  42,  15, 'Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it all around.'),
('EZE',  42,  20, 'He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall around it, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.'),
('EZE',  43,   2, 'Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory.'),

('EZE',  43,   8, 'in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their doorpost beside my doorpost, and there was [but] the wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed: therefore I have consumed them in my anger.'),
('EZE',  43,   9, 'Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me; and I will dwell in the midst of them forever.'),
('EZE',  43,  10, 'You, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.'),
('EZE',  43,  11, 'If they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and its fashion, and its exits, and its entrances, and all its forms, and all its ordinances, and all its forms, and all its laws; and write it in their sight; that they may keep the whole form of it, and all its ordinances, and do them.'),

('EZE',  43,  13, 'These are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and its border around its edge a span; and this shall be the base of the altar.'),
('EZE',  43,  14, 'From the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.'),

('EZE',  43,  18, 'He said to me, Son of man, thus says the Lord TheIAM: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.'),
('EZE',  43,  19, 'You shall give to the priests the Levites who are of the offspring of Zadok, who are near to me, to minister to me, says the Lord TheIAM, a young bull for a sin offering.'),
('EZE',  43,  20, 'You shall take of its blood, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border all around: thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.'),
('EZE',  43,  22, 'On the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bull.'),
('EZE',  43,  23, 'When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.'),
('EZE',  43,  24, 'You shall bring them near to TheIAM, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to TheIAM.'),

('EZE',  43,  27, 'When they have accomplished the days, it shall be that on the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, says the Lord TheIAM.'),
('EZE',  44,   2, 'TheIAM said to me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it; for TheIAM, the God of Israel, has entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut.'),

('EZE',  47,   5, 'Afterward he measured one thousand; [and it was] a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.'),
('EZE',  47,   6, 'He said to me, Son of man, have you seen [this]? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.'),
('EZE',  47,   8, 'Then he said to me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah; and they shall go toward the sea; into the sea [shall the waters go] which were made to issue forth; and the waters shall be healed.'),
('EZE',  47,   9, 'It shall happen, that every living creature which swarms, in every place where the rivers come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters are come there, and [the waters of the sea] shall be healed, and everything shall live wherever the river comes.'),
('EZE',  47,  10, 'It shall happen, that fishermen shall stand by it: from En Gedi even to En Eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.'),
('EZE',  47,  11, 'But the miry places of it, and its marshes, shall not be healed; they shall be given up to salt.'),
('EZE',  47,  12, 'By the river on its bank, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither, neither shall its fruit fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because its waters issue out of the sanctuary; and its fruit shall be for food, and its leaf for healing.'),
('EZE',  47,  13, 'Thus says the Lord TheIAM: This shall be the border, by which you shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph [shall have two] portions.'),

('DAN',   2,  32, 'As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,'),
('DAN',   2,  35, 'Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.'),
('DAN',   2,  36, 'This is the dream; and we will tell its interpretation before the king.'),
('DAN',   2,  37, 'You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;'),
('DAN',   2,  38, 'and wherever the children of men dwell, the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand, and has made you to rule over them all: you are the head of gold.'),
('DAN',   2,  39, 'After you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.'),
('DAN',   2,  40, 'The fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things; and as iron that crushes all these, shall it break in pieces and crush.'),
('DAN',   2,  41, 'Whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, because you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.'),
('DAN',   2,  42, 'As the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.'),
('DAN',   2,  43, 'Whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the offspring of men; but they shall not cling to one another, even as iron does not mingle with clay.'),
('DAN',   2,  44, 'In the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall its sovereignty be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.'),
('DAN',   2,  45, 'Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what shall happen hereafter: and the dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.'),
('DAN',   2,  46, 'Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odors to him.'),
('DAN',   2,  47, 'The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is God-God, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you have been able to reveal this secret.'),
('DAN',   2,  48, 'Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.'),
('DAN',   2,  49, 'Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king.'),
('DAN',   3,   1, 'Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits, and its breadth six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.'),
('DAN',   3,   2, 'Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.'),
('DAN',   3,   3, 'Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.'),
('DAN',   3,   4, 'Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, peoples, nations, and languages,'),
('DAN',   3,   5, 'that whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up;'),
('DAN',   3,   6, 'and whoever doesn't fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.'),
('DAN',   3,   9, 'They answered Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live for ever.'),
('DAN',   3,  10, 'You, O king, have made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;'),
('DAN',   3,  11, 'and whoever doesn't fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.'),
('DAN',   3,  12, 'There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not respected you. They don't serve your god, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.'),
('DAN',   3,  13, 'Then Nebuchadnezzar in [his] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.'),
('DAN',   3,  14, 'Nebuchadnezzar answered them, Is it on purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don't serve my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?'),
('DAN',   3,  15, 'Now if you are ready whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music to fall down and worship the image which I have made, [well]: but if you don't worship, you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?'),
('DAN',   3,  16, 'Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.'),
('DAN',   3,  17, 'If it be [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.'),
('DAN',   3,  18, 'But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your god, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.'),
('DAN',   3,  19, 'Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: [therefore] he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.'),
('DAN',   3,  20, 'He commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, [and] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.'),
('DAN',   3,  21, 'Then these men were bound in their pants, their tunics, and their mantles, and their [other] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.'),
('DAN',   3,  22, 'Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.'),
('DAN',   3,  23, 'These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.'),
('DAN',   3,  24, 'Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spoke and said to his counselors, Didn't we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered the king, True, O king.'),
('DAN',   3,  25, 'He answered, Look, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are unharmed; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of God.'),
('DAN',   3,  26, 'Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came forth out of the midst of the fire.'),
('DAN',   3,  27, 'The satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king's counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power on their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their pants changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.'),
('DAN',   3,  28, 'Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.'),
('DAN',   3,  29, 'Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything evil against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god who is able to deliver after this sort.'),
('DAN',   4,   1, 'Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.'),
('DAN',   4,   2, 'It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has worked toward me.'),
('DAN',   4,   3, 'How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.'),
('DAN',   4,   6, 'Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.'),
('DAN',   4,   7, 'Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me its interpretation.'),
('DAN',   4,   8, 'But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy God: and I told the dream before him, [saying],'),
('DAN',   4,   9, 'Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy God is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation.'),
('DAN',   4,  10, 'Thus were the visions of my head on my bed: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and its height was great.'),
('DAN',   4,  12, 'The leaves of it were beautiful, and its fruit much, and in it was food for all: the animals of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the sky lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.'),
('DAN',   4,  13, 'I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the sky.'),
('DAN',   4,  14, 'He cried aloud, and said thus, Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the animals get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.'),
('DAN',   4,  15, 'Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky: and let his portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth:'),
('DAN',   4,  16, 'let his heart be changed from man's, and let an animal's heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.'),
('DAN',   4,  17, 'The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will, and sets up over it the lowest of men.'),
('DAN',   4,  18, 'This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and you, Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able; for the spirit of the holy God is in you.'),
('DAN',   4,  19, 'Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken mute for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered, Belteshazzar, don't let the dream, or the interpretation, trouble you. Belteshazzar answered, My lord, the dream be to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your adversaries.'),
('DAN',   4,  21, 'whose leaves were beautiful, and its fruit much, and in it was food for all; under which the animals of the field lived, and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their habitation:'),
('DAN',   4,  22, 'it is you, O king, that are grown and become strong; for your greatness is grown, and reaches to the sky, and your dominion to the end of the earth.'),
('DAN',   4,  23, 'Whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from the sky, and saying, Cut down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of the sky: and let his portion be with the animals of the field, until seven times pass over him;'),
('DAN',   4,  24, 'this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come on my lord the king:'),
('DAN',   4,  25, 'that you shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field, and you shall be made to eat grass as oxen, and shall be wet with the dew of the sky, and seven times shall pass over you; until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.'),
('DAN',   4,  26, 'Whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; your kingdom shall be sure to you, after that you shall have known that the heavens do rule.'),
('DAN',   4,  27, 'Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of your tranquility.'),
('DAN',   4,  30, 'The king spoke and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?'),
('DAN',   4,  31, 'While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from the sky, [saying], O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you:'),
('DAN',   4,  32, 'and you shall be driven from men; and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field; you shall be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times shall pass over you; until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.'),
('DAN',   4,  33, 'The same hour was the thing fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the sky, until his hair was grown like eagles' [feathers], and his nails like birds' [claws].'),
('DAN',   4,  35, 'All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or ask him, What are you doing?'),
('DAN',   4,  36, 'At the same time my understanding returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned to me; and my counselors and my lords sought me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.'),
('DAN',   5,   2, 'Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink from them.'),
('DAN',   5,   3, 'Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them.'),
('DAN',   5,   4, 'They drank wine, and praised the god of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.'),
('DAN',   5,   5, 'In the same hour came forth the fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.'),
('DAN',   5,   7, 'The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever shall read this writing, and show me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.'),
('DAN',   5,   8, 'Then came in all the king's wise men; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.'),
('DAN',   5,   9, 'Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his face was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.'),
('DAN',   5,  10, '[Now] the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: the queen spoke and said, O king, live forever; don't let your thoughts trouble you, nor let your face be changed.'),
('DAN',   5,  11, 'There is a man in your kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy God; and in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of God, were found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar your father, the king, [I say], your father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;'),
('DAN',   5,  12, 'because an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.'),
('DAN',   5,  13, 'Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, Are you that Daniel, who are of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?'),
('DAN',   5,  14, 'I have heard of you, that the spirit of God is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you.'),
('DAN',   5,  16, 'But I have heard of you, that you can give interpretations, and dissolve doubts; now if you can read the writing, and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.'),
('DAN',   5,  17, 'Then Daniel answered before the king, Let your gifts be to yourself, and give your rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.'),
('DAN',   5,  18, 'You, king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty:'),
('DAN',   5,  19, 'and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he killed, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down.'),
('DAN',   5,  20, 'But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:'),
('DAN',   5,  21, 'and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the animals', and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the sky; until he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and that he sets up over it whomever he will.'),
('DAN',   5,  22, 'You, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this,'),
('DAN',   5,  23, 'but have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines, have drunk wine from them; and you have praised the god of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which don't see, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways, you have not glorified.'),
('DAN',   5,  24, 'Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.'),
('DAN',   5,  25, 'This is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.'),
('DAN',   5,  26, 'This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God has numbered your kingdom, and brought it to an end;'),
('DAN',   5,  27, 'TEKEL; you are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting.'),
('DAN',   5,  28, 'PERES; your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.'),
('DAN',   5,  29, 'Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.'),
('DAN',   6,   1, 'It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;'),
('DAN',   6,   2, 'and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account to them, and that the king should have no damage.'),
('DAN',   6,   3, 'Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.'),
('DAN',   6,   4, 'Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault, because he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.'),
('DAN',   6,   5, 'Then these men said, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.'),
('DAN',   6,   6, 'Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus to him, King Darius, live forever.'),
('DAN',   6,   7, 'All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counselors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of you, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.'),
('DAN',   6,   8, 'Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn't alter.'),
('DAN',   6,  10, 'When Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his room toward Jerusalem) and he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did before.'),
('DAN',   6,  11, 'Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.'),
('DAN',   6,  12, 'Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's decree: Haven't you signed an decree, that every man who shall make petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn't alter.'),
('DAN',   6,  13, 'Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, doesn't respect you, O king, nor the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.'),
('DAN',   6,  15, 'Then these men assembled together to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.'),
('DAN',   6,  16, 'Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. [Now] the king spoke and said to Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you.'),
('DAN',   6,  18, 'Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him.'),
('DAN',   6,  20, 'When he came near to the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spoke and said to Daniel, Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?'),
('DAN',   6,  21, 'Then Daniel said to the king, O king, live forever.'),
('DAN',   6,  22, 'My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me; because as before him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, have I done no hurt.'),
('DAN',   6,  23, 'Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.'),
('DAN',   6,  24, 'The king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.'),
('DAN',   6,  25, 'Then king Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.'),
('DAN',   6,  26, 'I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and steadfast forever, His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed; and his dominion shall be even to the end.'),
('DAN',   6,  27, 'He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.'),
('DAN',   7,   1, 'In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.'),
('DAN',   7,   2, 'Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the sky broke forth on the great sea.'),
('DAN',   7,   3, 'Four great animals came up from the sea, diverse one from another.'),
('DAN',   7,   4, 'The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I saw until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand on two feet as a man; and a man's heart was given to it.'),
('DAN',   7,   5, 'Behold, another animal, a second, like a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.'),
('DAN',   7,   6, 'After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the animal had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.'),
('DAN',   7,   7, 'After this I saw in the night visions, and, behold, a fourth animal, awesome and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the animals that were before it; and it had ten horns.'),
('DAN',   7,   8, 'I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.'),
('DAN',   7,   9, 'I saw until thrones were placed, and one who was ancient of days sat: his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, [and] its wheels burning fire.'),
('DAN',   7,  10, 'A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.'),
('DAN',   7,  11, 'I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke; I saw even until the animal was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.'),

('DAN',   8,   7, 'I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled on him; and there was none who could deliver the ram out of his hand.'),
('DAN',   8,   8, 'The male goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable [horns] toward the four winds of the sky.'),
('DAN',   8,   9, 'Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious [land].'),

('1CO',   5,  11, 'But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Don't even eat with such a person.'),
('1CO',   5,  12, 'For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Don't you judge those who are within?'),
('1CO',   6,   4, 'If then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly?'),
('1CO',   6,   8, 'No, but you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that against your brothers.'),
('1CO',   6,   9, 'Or don't you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don't be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,'),
('1CO',   6,  10, 'nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the Kingdom of God.'),
('1CO',   6,  11, 'Such were some of you, but you were washed. But you were sanctified. But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.'),
('1CO',   6,  13, '"Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods," but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.'),
('1CO',   6,  14, 'Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power.'),
('1CO',   6,  15, 'Don't you know that your bodies are members of the AnointedOne? Shall I then take the members of the AnointedOne, and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!'),
('1CO',   6,  16, 'Or don't you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For, "The two," says he, "will become one flesh."'),
('1CO',   6,  17, 'But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.'),
('1CO',   6,  19, 'Or don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you have from God? You are not your own,'),
('1CO',   7,   3, 'Let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.'),
('1CO',   7,  10, 'But to the married I command - not I, but the Lord - that the wife not leave her husband'),
('1CO',   7,  11, '(but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife.'),
('1CO',   7,  12, 'But to the rest I - not the Lord - say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her.'),
('1CO',   7,  17, 'Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. So I command in all the assemblies.'),
('1CO',   7,  22, 'For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord's free man. Likewise he who was called being free is the AnointedOne's bondservant.'),
('1CO',   7,  25, 'Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.'),
('1CO',   7,  26, 'I think that it is good therefore, because of the distress that is on us, that it is good for a man to be as he is.'),
('1CO',   7,  32, 'But I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;'),
('1CO',   7,  34, 'There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world - how she may please her husband.'),
('1CO',   7,  35, 'This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.'),
('1CO',   7,  37, 'But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, does well.'),
('1CO',   7,  39, 'A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whoever she desires, only in the Lord.'),
('1CO',   8,   1, 'Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.'),
('1CO',   8,   3, 'But if anyone loves God, he is known by him.'),
('1CO',   8,   5, 'For though there are things that are called "gods," whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many "gods" and many "Lords;"'),
('1CO',   8,   6, 'yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus AnointedOne, through whom are all things, and we live through him.'),
('1CO',   8,  11, 'And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake the AnointedOne died.'),
('1CO',   8,  12, 'Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against the AnointedOne.'),
('1CO',   8,  13, 'Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don't cause my brother to stumble.'),
('1CO',   9,   1, 'Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Haven't I seen Jesus AnointedOne, our Lord? Aren't you my work in the Lord?'),
('1CO',   9,   2, 'If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.'),
('1CO',   9,   3, 'My defense to those who examine me is this.'),
('1CO',   9,   5, 'Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?'),
('1CO',   9,  12, 'If others partake of this right over you, don't we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of the AnointedOne.'),
('1CO',   9,  14, 'Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News.'),
('1CO',   9,  16, 'For if I preach the Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me, if I don't preach the Good News.'),
('1CO',   9,  18, 'What then is my reward? That, when I preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of the AnointedOne without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News.'),
('1CO',   9,  21, 'to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward the AnointedOne), that I might win those who are without law.'),
('1CO',   9,  26, 'I therefore run like that, as not uncertainly. I fight like that, as not beating the air,'),
('1CO',  10,   4, 'and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was the AnointedOne.'),
('1CO',  10,   7, 'Neither be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."'),
('1CO',  10,   8, 'Neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell.'),
('1CO',  10,   9, 'Neither let us test the Lord, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents.'),
('1CO',  10,  10, 'Neither grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.'),
('1CO',  10,  14, 'Therefore, my dear-ones, flee from idolatry.'),
('1CO',  10,  16, 'The cup of blessing which we bless, isn't it a sharing of the blood of the AnointedOne? The bread which we break, isn't it a sharing of the body of the AnointedOne?'),
('1CO',  10,  21, 'You can't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can't both partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.'),
('1CO',  10,  22, 'Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?'),
('1CO',  10,  26, 'for "the earth is the Lord's, and its fullness."'),
('1CO',  10,  28, 'But if anyone says to you, "This was offered to idols," don't eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience. For "the earth is the Lord's, and all its fullness."'),
('1CO',  10,  30, 'If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?'),
('1CO',  10,  32, 'Give no occasions for stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the assembly of God;'),
('1CO',  11,   1, 'Be imitators of me, even as I also am of the AnointedOne.'),
('1CO',  11,   3, 'But I would have you know that the head of every man is the AnointedOne, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of the AnointedOne is God.'),
('1CO',  11,   5, 'But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved.'),
('1CO',  11,   6, 'For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.'),
('1CO',  11,   9, 'for neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man.'),
('1CO',  11,  10, 'For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels.'),
('1CO',  11,  11, 'Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord.'),
('1CO',  11,  20, 'When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.'),
('1CO',  11,  22, 'What, don't you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God's assembly, and put them to shame who don't have? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don't praise you.'),
('1CO',  11,  23, 'For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread.'),
('1CO',  11,  24, 'When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me."'),
('1CO',  11,  26, 'For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.'),
('1CO',  11,  27, 'Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord's cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.'),
('1CO',  11,  29, 'For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn't discern the Lord's body.'),
('1CO',  11,  32, 'But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.'),
('1CO',  12,   3, 'Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God's Spirit says, "Jesus is accursed." No one can say, "Jesus is Lord," but by the Holy Spirit.'),
('1CO',  12,   5, 'There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.'),
('1CO',  12,   6, 'There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who does all things in all.'),
('1CO',  12,  11, 'But the one and the same Spirit does all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.'),
('1CO',  12,  12, 'For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is the AnointedOne.'),
('1CO',  12,  26, 'When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.'),
('1CO',  12,  27, 'Now you are the body of the AnointedOne, and members individually.'),
('1CO',  13,   1, 'If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but don't have love, I have become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.'),
('1CO',  13,   2, 'If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but don't have love, I am nothing.'),
('1CO',  13,   3, 'If I dole out all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but don't have love, it profits me nothing.'),
('1CO',  13,   4, 'Love is patient and is kind; love doesn't envy. Love doesn't brag and isn't proud,'),
('1CO',  13,   7, 'bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.'),
('1CO',  13,   9, 'For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;'),
('1CO',  13,  13, 'But now faith, hope, and love remain - these three. The greatest of these is love.'),
('1CO',  14,   1, 'Follow after love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.'),
('1CO',  14,  10, 'There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without meaning.'),
('1CO',  14,  11, 'If then I don't know the meaning of the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me.'),
('1CO',  14,  21, 'In the law it is written, "By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. Not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord."'),
('1CO',  14,  26, 'What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build each other up.'),
('1CO',  14,  33, 'for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the assemblies of the saints,'),
('1CO',  14,  34, 'let your wives keep silent in the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as the law also says.'),
('1CO',  14,  35, 'If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly.'),
('1CO',  14,  36, 'What? Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone?'),
('1CO',  14,  37, 'If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.'),
('1CO',  15,   2, 'by which also you are saved, if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you - unless you believed in vain.'),
('1CO',  15,   3, 'For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that the AnointedOne died for our sins according to the Scriptures,'),
('1CO',  15,  10, 'But by the grace of God I am what I am. His grace which was bestowed on me was not futile, but I worked more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.'),
('1CO',  15,  12, 'Now if the AnointedOne is preached, that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?'),
('1CO',  15,  13, 'But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has the AnointedOne been raised.'),
('1CO',  15,  14, 'If the AnointedOne has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain.'),
('1CO',  15,  15, 'Yes, we are found false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that he raised up the AnointedOne, whom he didn't raise up, if the dead aren't ever raised.'),
('1CO',  15,  16, 'For if the dead aren't raised, neither has the AnointedOne been raised.'),
('1CO',  15,  17, 'If the AnointedOne has not been raised, your faith is in vain; you are still in your sins.'),
('1CO',  15,  18, 'Then they also who are fallen asleep in the AnointedOne have perished.'),
('1CO',  15,  19, 'If we have only hoped in the AnointedOne in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.'),
('1CO',  15,  20, 'But now the AnointedOne has been raised from the dead. He became the first fruits of those who are asleep.'),
('1CO',  15,  22, 'For as in Adam all die, so also in the AnointedOne all will be made alive.'),
('1CO',  15,  23, 'But each in his own order: the AnointedOne the first fruits, then those who are the AnointedOne's, at his coming.'),
('1CO',  15,  24, 'Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power.'),
('1CO',  15,  27, 'For, "He put all things in subjection under his feet." But when he says, "All things are put in subjection," it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.'),
('1CO',  15,  31, 'I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in AnointedOne Jesus our Lord, I die daily.'),
('1CO',  15,  32, 'If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, then "let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."'),
('1CO',  15,  40, 'There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial.'),
('1CO',  15,  42, 'So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.'),
('1CO',  15,  47, 'The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from heaven.'),
('1CO',  15,  50, 'Now I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood can't inherit the Kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.'),
('1CO',  15,  52, 'in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.'),
('1CO',  15,  53, 'For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.'),
('1CO',  15,  54, 'But when this corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written will happen: "Death is swallowed up in victory."'),
('1CO',  15,  55, '"Death, where is your sting? Hades, where is your victory?"'),
('1CO',  15,  57, 'But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus AnointedOne.'),
('1CO',  15,  58, 'Therefore, my dear brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord's work, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.'),
('1CO',  16,   2, 'On the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.'),
('1CO',  16,   7, 'For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.'),
('1CO',  16,  10, 'Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.'),
('1CO',  16,  14, 'Let all that you do be done in love.'),
('1CO',  16,  15, 'Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints),'),
('1CO',  16,  19, 'The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.'),
('1CO',  16,  22, 'If any man doesn't love the Lord Jesus AnointedOne, let him be accursed. Maranatha!'),

('2CO',   1,   3, 'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus AnointedOne, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;'),
('2CO',   1,   5, 'For as the sufferings of the AnointedOne abound to us, even so our comfort also abounds through the AnointedOne.'),
('2CO',   1,   7, 'Our hope for you is steadfast, knowing that, since you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the comfort.'),
('2CO',   1,  11, 'you also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed on us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf.'),
('2CO',   1,  13, 'For we write no other things to you, than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end;'),
('2CO',   1,  14, 'as also you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.'),
('2CO',   1,  15, 'In this confidence, I was determined to come first to you, that you might have a second benefit;'),
('2CO',   1,  19, 'For the Son of God, Jesus AnointedOne, who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not "Yes and no," but in him is "Yes."'),
('2CO',   1,  20, 'For however many are the promises of God, in him is the "Yes." Therefore also through him is the "Amen," to the glory of God through us.'),
('2CO',   1,  21, 'Now he who establishes us with you in the AnointedOne, and anointed us, is God;'),
('2CO',   1,  24, 'Not that we dominate your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your joy. For you stand firm in faith.'),
('2CO',   2,   2, 'For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?'),
('2CO',   2,   4, 'For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you.'),
('2CO',   2,   6, 'Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;'),
('2CO',   2,   8, 'Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.'),
('2CO',   2,  10, 'Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of the AnointedOne,'),
('2CO',   2,  11, 'that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.'),
('2CO',   2,  12, 'Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of the AnointedOne, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,'),

('2CO',   2,  15, 'For we are a sweet aroma of the AnointedOne to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;'),
('2CO',   2,  16, 'to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?'),
('2CO',   2,  17, 'For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in the AnointedOne.'),
('2CO',   3,   2, 'You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;'),
('2CO',   3,   3, 'being revealed that you are a letter of the AnointedOne, served by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh.'),
('2CO',   3,   4, 'Such confidence we have through the AnointedOne toward God;'),
('2CO',   3,   5, 'not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;'),
('2CO',   3,   6, 'who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.'),
('2CO',   3,   7, 'But if the service of death, written engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which was passing away:'),
('2CO',   3,  14, 'But their minds were hardened, for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains, because in the AnointedOne it passes away.'),
('2CO',   3,  16, 'But whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.'),
('2CO',   3,  17, 'Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.'),

('2CO',   4,   2, 'But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.'),
('2CO',   4,   3, 'Even if our Good News is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish;'),
('2CO',   4,   4, 'in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the Good News of the glory of the AnointedOne, who is the image of God, should not dawn on them.'),
('2CO',   4,   5, 'For we don't preach ourselves, but AnointedOne Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake;'),
('2CO',   4,   6, 'seeing it is God who said, "Out of darkness light shall shine," who has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus AnointedOne.'),
('2CO',   4,  10, 'always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.'),
('2CO',   4,  12, 'So then death works in us, but life in you.'),
('2CO',   4,  13, 'But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, "I believed, and therefore I spoke." We also believe, and therefore also we speak;'),
('2CO',   4,  14, 'knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.'),
('2CO',   4,  16, 'Therefore we don't faint, but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.'),
('2CO',   4,  17, 'For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;'),
('2CO',   5,   2, 'For most certainly in this we groan, longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven;'),
('2CO',   5,   3, 'if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked.'),
('2CO',   5,   4, 'For indeed we who are in this tent do groan, being burdened; not that we desire to be unclothed, but that we desire to be clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.'),
('2CO',   5,   6, 'Therefore, we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord;'),
('2CO',   5,   8, 'We are courageous, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.'),
('2CO',   5,  10, 'For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of the AnointedOne; that each one may receive the things in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.'),
('2CO',   5,  11, 'Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are revealed to God; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences.'),
('2CO',   5,  14, 'For the love of the AnointedOne constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died.'),
('2CO',   5,  16, 'Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on. Even though we have known the AnointedOne after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.'),
('2CO',   5,  17, 'Therefore if anyone is in the AnointedOne, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold, all things have become new.'),
('2CO',   5,  18, 'But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus AnointedOne, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;'),
('2CO',   5,  19, 'namely, that God was in the AnointedOne reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.'),
('2CO',   5,  20, 'We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of the AnointedOne, as though God were entreating by us: we beg you on behalf of the AnointedOne, be reconciled to God.'),
('2CO',   6,   1, 'Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,'),
('2CO',   6,   2, 'for he says, "At an acceptable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you." Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation.'),
('2CO',   6,   6, 'in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,'),
('2CO',   6,  13, 'Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be open wide.'),
('2CO',   6,  14, 'Don't be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?'),
('2CO',   6,  15, 'What agreement has the AnointedOne with Belial? Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?'),
('2CO',   6,  16, 'What agreement has a temple of God with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God said, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people."'),
('2CO',   6,  17, 'Therefore, "'Come out from among them, and be separate,' says the Lord. 'Touch no unclean thing. I will receive you.'),
('2CO',   6,  18, 'I will be to you a Father. You will be to me sons and daughters,' says the Lord Almighty."'),
('2CO',   7,   1, 'Having therefore these promises, dear-ones, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.'),
('2CO',   7,   3, 'I say this not to condemn you, for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live together.'),
('2CO',   7,   6, 'Nevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;'),
('2CO',   7,   7, 'and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, while he told us of your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced still more.'),
('2CO',   7,   8, 'For though I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it. For I see that my letter made you sorry, though just for a while.'),
('2CO',   7,   9, 'I now rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly way, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing.'),
('2CO',   7,  10, 'For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, which brings no regret. But the sorrow of the world works death.'),
('2CO',   7,  11, 'For behold, this same thing, that you were made sorry in a godly way, what earnest care it worked in you. Yes, what defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter.'),
('2CO',   8,   1, 'Moreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia;'),
('2CO',   8,   2, 'how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.'),
('2CO',   8,   5, 'This was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.'),
('2CO',   8,   6, 'So we urged Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace.'),
('2CO',   8,   7, 'But as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that you also abound in this grace.'),
('2CO',   8,   8, 'I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.'),
('2CO',   8,   9, 'For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus AnointedOne, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich.'),
('2CO',   8,  10, 'I give a judgment in this: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do, but also to be willing.'),
('2CO',   8,  18, 'We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known through all the assemblies.'),
('2CO',   8,  19, 'Not only so, but who was also appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness.'),
('2CO',   8,  21, 'Having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.'),
('2CO',   8,  23, 'As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are the apostles of the assemblies, the glory of the AnointedOne.'),
('2CO',   8,  24, 'Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf.'),
('2CO',   9,   2, 'for I know your readiness, of which I boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for a year past. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them.'),
('2CO',   9,   4, 'so that I won't by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) should be disappointed in this confident boasting.'),
('2CO',   9,   5, 'I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness.'),
('2CO',   9,   7, 'Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.'),
('2CO',   9,   9, 'As it is written, "He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor. His righteousness remains forever."'),
('2CO',   9,  10, 'Now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;'),
('2CO',   9,  11, 'you being enriched in everything to all liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.'),
('2CO',   9,  12, 'For this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God;'),
('2CO',   9,  13, 'seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of the AnointedOne, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all;'),
('2CO',  10,   1, 'Now I Paul, myself, entreat you by the humility and gentleness of the AnointedOne; I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.'),
('2CO',  10,   5, 'throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of the AnointedOne;'),
('2CO',  10,   6, 'and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience will be made full.'),
('2CO',  10,   7, 'Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face? If anyone trusts in himself that he is the AnointedOne's, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is the AnointedOne's, so also we are the AnointedOne's.'),
('2CO',  10,   8, 'For though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down) I will not be disappointed,'),
('2CO',  10,  10, 'For, "His letters," they say, "are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is despised."'),
('2CO',  10,  14, 'For we don't stretch ourselves too much, as though we didn't reach to you. For we came even as far as to you with the Good News of the AnointedOne,'),
('2CO',  10,  17, 'But "he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord."'),
('2CO',  10,  18, 'For it isn't he who commends himself who is approved, but whom the Lord commends.'),
('2CO',  11,   2, 'For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. For I married you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to the AnointedOne.'),
('2CO',  11,   3, 'But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is in the AnointedOne.'),
('2CO',  11,   4, 'For if he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different "good news", which you did not accept, you put up with that well enough.'),
('2CO',  11,  10, 'As the truth of the AnointedOne is in me, no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia.'),
('2CO',  11,  11, 'Why? Because I don't love you? God knows!'),
('2CO',  11,  12, 'But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion, that in which they boast, they may be found even as we.'),
('2CO',  11,  13, 'For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as the AnointedOne's apostles.'),
('2CO',  11,  15, 'It is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their actions.'),
('2CO',  11,  17, 'That which I speak, I don't speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.'),
('2CO',  11,  20, 'For you bear with a man, if he brings you into slavery, if he devours you, if he takes you captive, if he exalts himself, if he strikes you on the face.'),
('2CO',  11,  21, 'I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet however any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.'),
('2CO',  11,  22, 'Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.'),
('2CO',  11,  23, 'Are they servants of the AnointedOne? (I speak as one beside himself) I am more so; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.'),
('2CO',  11,  24, 'Five times from the Jews I received forty stripes minus one.'),
('2CO',  11,  28, 'Besides those things that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily, anxiety for all the assemblies.'),
('2CO',  11,  31, 'The God and Father of the Lord Jesus AnointedOne, he who is blessed forevermore, knows that I don't lie.'),
('2CO',  11,  32, 'In Damascus the governor under King Aretas guarded the city of the Damascenes desiring to arrest me.'),
('2CO',  11,  33, 'Through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.'),
('2CO',  12,   1, 'It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.'),
('2CO',  12,   2, 'I know a man in the AnointedOne, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don't know, or whether out of the body, I don't know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven.'),
('2CO',  12,   6, 'For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me.'),
('2CO',  12,   7, 'By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.'),
('2CO',  12,   8, 'Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.'),
('2CO',  12,   9, 'He has said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of the AnointedOne may rest on me.'),
('2CO',  12,  10, 'Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for the AnointedOne's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.'),
('2CO',  12,  11, 'I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.'),
('2CO',  12,  12, 'Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty actions.'),
('2CO',  12,  15, 'I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?'),
('2CO',  12,  16, 'But be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.'),
('2CO',  12,  17, 'Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you?'),
('2CO',  12,  19, 'Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in the AnointedOne. But all things, dear-ones, are for your edifying.'),
('2CO',  12,  20, 'For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don't desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots;'),
('2CO',  12,  21, 'that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed.'),
('2CO',  13,   3, 'seeing that you seek a proof of the AnointedOne who speaks in me; who toward you is not weak, but is powerful in you.'),
('2CO',  13,   5, 'Test your own selves, whether you are in the faith. Test your own selves. Or don't you know as to your own selves, that Jesus AnointedOne is in you? - unless indeed you are disqualified.'),
('2CO',  13,   9, 'For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. And this we also pray for, even your perfecting.'),
('2CO',  13,  10, 'For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not deal sharply when present, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for tearing down.'),
('2CO',  13,  11, 'Finally, brothers, rejoice. Be perfected, be comforted, be of the same mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.'),
('2CO',  13,  14, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus AnointedOne, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. Amen.'),
('GAL',   1,   1, 'Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus AnointedOne, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),'),

('GAL',   1,   4, 'who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father -'),
('GAL',   1,   6, 'I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of the AnointedOne to a different "good news";'),
('GAL',   1,   7, 'and there isn't another "good news." Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the Good News of the AnointedOne.'),
('GAL',   1,  10, 'For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn't be a servant of the AnointedOne.'),
('GAL',   1,  12, 'For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus AnointedOne.'),
('GAL',   1,  13, 'For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.'),
('GAL',   1,  15, 'But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me through his grace,'),
('GAL',   1,  19, 'But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord's brother.'),
('GAL',   1,  22, 'I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in the AnointedOne,'),
('GAL',   1,  24, 'And they glorified God in me.'),
('GAL',   2,   4, 'This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in AnointedOne Jesus, that they might bring us into slavery;'),
('GAL',   2,   6, 'But from those who were reputed to be important (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn't show partiality to man) - they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to me,'),
('GAL',   2,   7, 'but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcision'),
('GAL',   2,   8, '(for he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also to the Gentiles);'),
('GAL',   2,   9, 'and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision.'),
('GAL',   2,  10, 'They only asked us to remember the poor - which very thing I was also zealous to do.'),
('GAL',   2,  13, 'And the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.'),
('GAL',   2,  16, 'yet knowing that a man is not justified by the actions of the law but through faith in Jesus AnointedOne, even we believed in AnointedOne Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in the AnointedOne, and not by the actions of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the actions of the law.'),
('GAL',   2,  17, 'But if, while we sought to be justified in the AnointedOne, we ourselves also were found sinners, is the AnointedOne a servant of sin? Certainly not!'),
('GAL',   2,  20, 'I have been crucified with the AnointedOne, and it is no longer I that live, but the AnointedOne living in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.'),

('GAL',   3,   5, 'He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the actions of the law, or by hearing of faith?'),
('GAL',   3,   6, 'Even as Abraham "believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness."'),
('GAL',   3,   7, 'Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham.'),
('GAL',   3,  10, 'For as many as are of the actions of the law are under a curse. For it is written, "Cursed is everyone who doesn't continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them."'),

('GAL',   3,  16, 'Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He doesn't say, "To seeds," as of many, but as of one, "To your seed," which is the AnointedOne.'),
('GAL',   3,  17, 'Now I say this. A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in the AnointedOne, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.'),
('GAL',   3,  19, 'What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.'),
('GAL',   3,  22, 'But the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus AnointedOne might be given to those who believe.'),
('GAL',   3,  24, 'So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to the AnointedOne, that we might be justified by faith.'),
('GAL',   3,  26, 'For you are all children of God, through faith in AnointedOne Jesus.'),
('GAL',   3,  27, 'For as many of you as were baptized into the AnointedOne have put on the AnointedOne.'),
('GAL',   3,  28, 'There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in AnointedOne Jesus.'),
('GAL',   3,  29, 'If you are the AnointedOne's, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise.'),
('GAL',   4,   1, 'But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is Lord of all;'),
('GAL',   4,   5, 'that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of children.'),
('GAL',   4,   7, 'So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through the AnointedOne.'),
('GAL',   4,  13, 'but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time.'),
('GAL',   4,  14, 'That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didn't despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as AnointedOne Jesus.'),
('GAL',   4,  19, 'My little children, of whom I am again in travail until the AnointedOne is formed in you -'),
('GAL',   4,  22, 'For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the free woman.'),
('GAL',   4,  23, 'However, the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise.'),
('GAL',   4,  27, 'For it is written, "Rejoice, you barren who don't bear. Break forth and shout, you that don't travail. For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has a husband."'),
('GAL',   4,  30, 'However what does the Scripture say? "Throw out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman."'),
('GAL',   4,  31, 'So then, brothers, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the free woman.'),
('GAL',   5,   1, 'For freedom the AnointedOne has made us free; therefore stand firm and don't be entangled again with a yoke of slavery.'),

('GAL',   5,   4, 'You are alienated from the AnointedOne, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.'),
('GAL',   5,   6, 'For in AnointedOne Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.'),
('GAL',   5,  10, 'I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.'),
('GAL',   5,  13, 'For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don't use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.'),
('GAL',   5,  14, 'For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."'),
('GAL',   5,  19, 'Now the actions of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,'),
('GAL',   5,  21, 'envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.'),
('GAL',   5,  22, 'But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,'),

('HEB',   9,  23, 'It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.'),
