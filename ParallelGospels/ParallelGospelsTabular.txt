Event 50: Jesus heals an invalid at the pool of Bethesda on the Sabbath	Time: fall 31 A.D., 8th day Tabernacles, Shimini Atzaret October 27, 31 A.D. (Saturday)	Place: Jerusalem, Judea

John 5:1-46
5:1†After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.†
5:1 ?et? ta?ta ?? ? ???t? t?? ???da???, ?a? ???ﬂ? ? ??s??? e?? ?e??s???µa.
5:2†Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, "Bethesda," having five porches.†5:3†In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;†5:4†for an angel of the Lord went down at certainTimes into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.†

Now it was the Sabbath on that day.†

5:14†Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, "Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you."

5:15 ?p???e? ? ?????p??, ?a? ?????e??e? t??? ???da???? ?t? ??s??? ?st?? ? p???sa? a?t?? ????.
5:16†For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.†

5:17†But Jesus answered them, "My Father is still working, so I am working, too."†5:18†For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.†

5:19†Jesus therefore answered them, "Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.†5:20†For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.†5:21†For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.†5:22†For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,†5:23†that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn't honor the Son doesn't honor the Father who sent him.

You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.
7:8†"For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things."†7:9†He said to them, "Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.†7:10†For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother;'†[Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16] and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.' [Exodus 20:17; Leviticus 20:9] 7:11†But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother, "Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban [a Hebrew word for an offering devoted to God], that is to say, given to God;"'†7:12 then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,†7:13†making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down.

Event 75:	Jesus at the Feast of Tabernacles: the man born blind controversy	Time: October 18, 32 A.D. (Saturday)	Place: Jerusalem

John 9:1-10:6
9:1†As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.†
9:1 ?a? pa????? e?de? ?????p?? t?f??? ?? ?e?et??.
9:2†His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"
9:2 ?a? ???t?sa? a?t?? ?? µa??ta? a?t?? ?????te?, ?aﬂﬂ?, t?? ?µa?te?, ??t?? ? ?? ???e?? a?t??, ??a t?f??? ?e?????;

9:4†I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.†9:5†While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."†

9:6†When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man's eyes with the mud,†

9:7 ?a? e?pe? a?t?, ?pa?e ???a? e?? t?? ????µﬂ???a? t?? S????µñ? ??µ??e?eta?, ?pesta?µ????.
So he went away, washed, and came B.C.seeing.†
?p???e? ??? ?a? ????at?, ?a? ???e? ﬂ??p??.
9:8†The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, "Isn't this he who sat and begged?"†9:9†Others were saying, "It is he." Still others were saying, "He looks like him."
9:8 ?? ??? ?e?t??e? ?a? ?? ?e?????te? a?t?? t? p??te??? ?t? t?f??? ??, ??e???, ??? ??t?? ?st?? ? ?a??µe??? ?a? p??sa?t??; 9:9 ????? ??e??? ?t? ??t?? ?st??? ????? d? ?t? ?µ???? a?t? ?st??.

??e???? ??e?e? ?t? ??? e?µ?. 9:10 ??e??? ??? a?t?, ??? ??e????s?? s?? ?? ?f?a?µ??;
9:11†He answered, "A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.' So I went away and washed, and I received sight."
9:11 ?pe????? ??e???? ?a? e?pe?, ?????p?? ?e??µe??? ??s??? p???? ?p???se?, ?a? ?p????s?? µ?? t??? ?f?a?µ???, ?a? e?p?? µ??, ?pa?e e?? t?? ????µﬂ???a? t?? S????µ, ?a? ???a?. ?pe???? d? ?a? ????µe???, ???ﬂ?e?a.
9:12†Then they asked him, "Where is he?"
9:12 ??p?? ??? a?t?, ??? ?st?? ??e????;
He said, "I don't know."
???e?, ??? ??da.
9:13†They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.†9:14†It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.†
9:13 ????s?? a?t?? p??? t??? Fa??sa????, t?? p?te t?f???. 9:14 ?? d? s?ﬂﬂat?? ?te t?? p???? ?p???se? ? ??s???, ?a? ?????e? a?t?? t??? ?f?a?µ???.
9:15†Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight.
9:15 ????? ??? ???t?? a?t?? ?a? ?? Fa??sa???, p?? ???ﬂ?e?e?.
He said to them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see."
? d? e?pe? a?t???, ????? ?p?????? µ?? ?p? t??? ?f?a?µ???, ?a? ?????µ??, ?a? ﬂ??p?.
9:16†Some therefore of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, because he doesn't keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?" There was division among them.†
9:16 ??e??? ??? ?? t?? Fa??sa??? t????, ??t?? ? ?????p?? ??? ?st?? pa?? t?? ?e??, ?t? t? s?ﬂﬂat?? ?? t??e?. ????? ??e???, ??? d??ata? ?????p?? ?µa?t???? t??a?ta s?µe?a p??e??; ?a? s??sµa ?? ?? a?t???.
9:17†Therefore they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?"
9:17 ?????s?? t? t?f?? p????, S? t? ???e?? pe?? a?t??, ?t? ??????? s?? t??? ?f?a?µ???;
He said, "He is a prophet."
? d? e?pe? ?t? ???f?t?? ?st??.
9:18†The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,†9:19†and asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"
9:18 ??? ?p?ste?sa? ??? ?? ???da??? pe?? a?t??, ?t? t?f??? ?? ?a? ???ﬂ?e?e?, ??? ?t?? ?f???sa? t??? ???e?? a?t?? t?? ??aﬂ???a?t??, 9:19 ?a? ???t?sa? a?t??? ?????te?, ??t?? ?st?? ? ???? ?µ??, ?? ?µe?? ???ete ?t? t?f??? ??e?????; ??? ??? ??t? ﬂ??pe?;
9:20†His parents answered them, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;†9:21†but how he now sees, we don't know; or who opened his eyes, we don't know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself."†
9:20 ?pe?????sa? d? a?t??? ?? ???e?? a?t?? ?a? e?p??, ??daµe? ?t? ??t?? ?st?? ? ???? ?µ??, ?a? ?t? t?f??? ??e?????? 9:21 p?? d? ??? ﬂ??pe?, ??? ??daµe?? ? t?? ?????e? a?t?? t??? ?f?a?µ???, ?µe?? ??? ??daµe?? a?t?? ?????a? ??e?? a?t?? ???t?sate, a?t?? pe?? ?a?t?? ?a??se?.
9:22†His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.†9:23†Therefore his parents said, "He is of age. Ask him."
9;22 ?a?ta e?p?? ?? ???e?? a?t??, ?t? ?f?ﬂ???t? t??? ???da????? ?d? ??? s??et??e??t? ?? ???da???, ??a ??? t?? a?t?? ?µ?????s? ???st??, ?p?s???????? ????ta?. 9:23 ??? t??t? ?? ???e?? a?t?? e?p?? ?t? ?????a? ??e?, a?t?? ???t?sate.
9:24†So they called the man who was blind a secondTime, and said to him, "Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner."

9:26 ??p?? d? a?t? p????, ?? ?p???s?? s??; ??? ??????? s?? t??? ?f?a?µ???;

[Psalm 66:18; Proverbs 15:29; 28:9]†9:32†Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.†9:33†If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."

wouldn't for a while, but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I neither fear God, nor respect man,†18:5†yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.'"

I give tithes of all that I get.'†18:13†But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn't even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'†18:14†I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted."

tree withered away.†21:20†When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree immediately wither away?"

a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard--very costly. She broke the jar, and poured it over his head.
12:3†Mary, therefore, took a pound†of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair.

14:4†But there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, "Why has this ointment been wasted?†14:5†For this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii [about a year's wage for an agricultural labourer],†and given to the poor." They grumbled against her.
12:4†Then Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,†12:5†"Why wasn't this ointment sold for three hundred denarii [about a year's wages for an agricultural labourer],†and given to the poor?"

14:6†But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her?
