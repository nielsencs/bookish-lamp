<div class='mt'>World English Bible Glossary </div><div class='ip'>The following words used in the World English Bible (WEB) are not very common, either because they refer to ancient weights, measures, or money, or because they are in some way unique to the Bible. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Abaddon</span> Abaddon is Hebrew for destruction. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Abba</span> Abba is a Chaldee word for father, used in a respectful, affectionate, and familiar way, like papa, dad, or daddy. Often used in prayer to refer to our Father in Heaven. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>adultery</span> Adultery is having sexual intercourse with someone besides your own husband or wife. In the Bible, the only legitimate sexual intercourse is between a man and a woman who are married to each other. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>alpha</span> Alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet. It is sometimes used to mean the beginning or the first. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>amen</span> Amen means “So be it” or “I believe it is certainly so.” </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>angel</span> “Angel” literally means “messenger” or “envoy,” and is usually used to refer to spiritual beings who normally are invisible to us, but can also appear as exceedingly strong creatures or as humans. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Apollyon</span> Apollyon is Greek for destroyer. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>apostle</span> “Apostle” means a delegate, messenger, or one sent forth with orders. This term is applied in the New Testament in both a general sense connected with a ministry of establishing and strengthening church fellowships, as well as in a specific sense to “The 12 Apostles of the Lamb” (<a href='REV21.htm#V14'>Revelation 21:14</a>). The former category applies to a specific ministry that continues in the Church (<a href='EPH04.htm#V11'>Ephesians 4:11-13</a>) and which includes many more than 12 people, while the latter refers to the apostles named in <a href='MAT10.htm#V2'>Matthew 10:2-4,</a> except with Judas Iscariot replaced by Matthias (<a href='ACT01.htm#V26'>Acts 1:26</a>). </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Armageddon</span> See Har-magedon. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>assarion</span> An assarion is a small Roman copper coin worth one tenth of a drachma, or about an hour’s wages for an agricultural laborer. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>aureus</span> An aureus is a Roman gold coin, worth 25 silver denarii. An aureus weighed from 115 to 126.3 grains (7.45 to 8.18 grams). </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>baptize</span> Baptize means to immerse in, or wash with something, usually water. Baptism in the Holy Spirit, fire, the Body of Christ, and suffering are also mentioned in the New Testament, along with baptism in water. Baptism is not just to cleanse the body, but as an outward sign of an inward spiritual cleansing and commitment. Baptism is a sign of repentance, as practiced by John the Baptizer, and of faith in Jesus Christ, as practiced by Jesus’ disciples. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>bath</span> A bath is a liquid measure of about 22 liters, 5.8 U. S. gallons, or 4.8 imperial gallons. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>batos</span> A batos is a liquid measure of about 39.5 liters, 10.4 U. S. gallons, or 8.7 imperial gallons. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Beelzebul</span> literally, lord of the flies. A name used for the devil. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Beersheba</span> Beersheba is Hebrew for “well of the oath” or “well of the seven.” A city in Israel. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>behold</span> Look!

A choenix was the daily ration of grain for a soldier in some armies. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>concubine</span> a woman who is united to a man for the purpose of providing him with sexual pleasure and children, but not being honored as a full partner in marriage; a second-class wife. In Old Testament times (and in some places now), it was the custom of middle-eastern kings, chiefs, and wealthy men to marry multiple wives and concubines, but God commanded the Kings of Israel not to do so (<a href='DEU17.htm#V17'>Deuteronomy 17:17</a>) and Jesus encouraged people to either remain single or marry as God originally intended: one man married to one woman (<a href='MAT19.htm#V3'>Matthew 19:3-12</a>; <a href='1CO07.htm#V1'>1 Corinthians 7:1-13</a>). </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>cor</span> A cor is a dry measure of about 391 liters, 103 U. S. gallons, or 86 imperial gallons. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>corban</span> Corban is a Hebrew word for an offering devoted to God. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>crucify</span> Crucify means to execute someone by nailing them to a cross with metal spikes. Their hands are stretched out on the crossbeam with spikes driven through their wrists or hands. Their feet or ankles are attached to a cross with a metal spike. The weight of the victim’s body tends to force the air out of his lungs. To rise up to breathe, the victim has to put weight on the wounds, and use a lot of strength. The victim is nailed to the cross while the cross is on the ground, then the cross is raised up and dropped into a hole, thus jarring the wounds. Before crucifixion, the victim was usually whipped with a Roman cat of nine tails, which had bits of glass and metal tied to its ends. This caused chunks of flesh to be removed and open wounds to be placed against the raw wood of the cross. The victim was made to carry the heavy crossbeam of his cross from the place of judgment to the place of crucifixion, but often was physically unable after the scourging, so another person would be pressed into involuntary service to carry the cross for him. Roman crucifixion was generally done totally naked to maximize both shame and discomfort. Eventually, the pain, weakness, dehydration, and exhaustion of the muscles needed to breathe make breathing impossible, and the victim suffocates. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>cubit</span> A cubit is a unit of linear measure, from the elbow to the tip of the longest finger of a man. This unit is commonly converted to 0.46 meters or 18 inches, although that varies with height of the man doing the measurement. There is also a “long” cubit that is longer than a regular cubit by a handbreadth. (<a href='EZK43.htm#V13'>Ezekiel 43:13</a>) </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>cummin</span> Cummin is an aromatic seed from Cuminum cyminum, resembling caraway in flavor and appearance. It is used as a spice. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>darnel</span> Darnel is a weed grass (probably bearded darnel or Lolium temulentum) that looks very much like wheat until it is mature, when the seeds reveal a great difference. Darnel seeds aren’t good for much except as chicken feed or to burn to prevent the spread of this weed. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>denarii</span> denarii: plural form of denarius, a silver Roman coin worth about a day’s wages for a laborer. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>denarius</span> A denarius is a silver Roman coin worth about a day’s wages for an agricultural laborer. A denarius was worth 1/25th of a Roman aureus. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>devil</span> The word “devil” comes from the Greek “diabolos,” which means “one prone to slander; a liar.” “Devil” is used to refer to a fallen angel, also called “Satan,” who works to steal, kill, destroy, and do evil. The devil’s doom is certain, and it is only a matter of time before he is thrown into the Lake of Fire, never to escape. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>didrachma</span> A didrachma is a Greek silver coin worth 2 drachmas, about as much as 2 Roman denarii, or about 2 days wages. It was commonly used to pay the half-shekel temple tax. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>disciple</span> a student who follows a teacher to learn both by precept and example. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>distaff</span> part of a spinning wheel used for twisting threads. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>drachma</span> A drachma is a Greek silver coin worth about one Roman denarius, or about a day’s wages for an agricultural laborer. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>El-Elohe-Israel</span> El-Elohe-Israel means “God, the God of Israel” or “The God of Israel is mighty.” </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>ephah</span> An ephah is a measure of volume of about 22 liters, 5.8 U. S. gallons, 4.8 imperial gallons, or a bit more than half a bushel. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Gehenna</span> Gehenna is one word used for Hell. It comes from the Hebrew Gey-Hinnom, literally “valley of Hinnom.” This word originated as the name for a place south of the old city of Jerusalem where the city’s rubbish was burned. At one time, live babies were thrown crying into the fire under the arms of the idol, Moloch, to die there. This place was so despised by the people after the righteous King Josiah abolished this hideous practice that it was made into a garbage heap. Bodies of diseased animals and executed criminals were thrown there and burned. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>gittith</span> Gittith is a musical term possibly meaning “an instrument of Gath.” </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>goad</span> a sharp, pointed prodding device used to motivate reluctant animals (such as oxen and mules) to move in the right direction. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>gospel</span> Gospel means “good news” or “glad tidings,” specifically the Good News of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection for our salvation, healing, and provision; and the hope of eternal life that Jesus made available to us by God’s grace. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Hades</span> Hades: The nether realm of the disembodied spirits.

This area has a large valley plain with plenty of room for armies to maneuver. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>hin</span> A hin is a measure of volume of about about 6.5 liters or 1.7 gallons. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>homer</span> One homer is about 220 liters, 6.2 U. S. bushels, 6.1 imperial bushels, 58 U. S. gallons, or 48.4 imperial gallons. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>hypocrite</span> a stage actor; someone who pretends to be someone other than who they really are; a pretender; a dissembler </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Ishmael</span> Ishmael is the son of Abraham and Hagar. Ishmael literally means, “God hears.” </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Jehovah</span> See “Yahweh.” </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Jesus</span> “Jesus” is Greek for the Hebrew name “Yeshua,” which is a short version of “Yehoshua,” which comes from “Yoshia,” which means “He will save.” </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>kodrantes</span> A kodrantes is a small coin worth one half of an Attic chalcus or two lepta.

God’s plan for marriage is between one man and one woman (<a href='MRK10.htm#V6'>Mark 10:6-9</a>; 1 Corinthians 7). Although there are many cases of a man marrying more than one woman in the Old Testament, being married to one wife is a requirement to serve in certain church leadership positions (<a href='1TI03.htm#V2'>1 Timothy 3:2,12</a>; <a href='TIT01.htm#V5'>Titus 1:5-6</a>). </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>maschil</span> Maschil is a musical and literary term for “contemplation” or “meditative psalm.” </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>michtam</span> A michtam is a poem. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>mina</span> A mina is a Greek coin worth 100 Greek drachmas (or 100 Roman denarii), or about 100 day’s wages for an agricultural laborer. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>myrrh</span> Myrrh is the fragrant substance that oozes out of the stems and branches of the low, shrubby tree commiphora myrrha or commiphora kataf native to the Arabian deserts and parts of Africa.

(<a href='1TH05.htm#V23'>1 Thessalonians 5:23,</a> <a href='HEB04.htm#V12'>Hebrews 4:12</a>) </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>span</span> A span is the length from the tip of a man’s thumb to the tip of his little finger when his hand is stretched out (about half a cubit, or 9 inches, or 22.8 cm.) </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>spirit</span> Spirit, breath, and wind all derive from the same Hebrew and Greek words. A person’s spirit is the very essence of that person’s life, which comes from God, who is a Spirit being (<a href='JHN04.htm#V24'>John 4:24,</a> <a href='GEN01.htm#V2'>Genesis 1:2</a>; <a href='GEN02.htm#V7'>2:7</a>). The Bible distinguishes between a person’s spirit, soul, and body (<a href='1TH05.htm#V23'>1 Thessalonians 5:23,</a> <a href='HEB04.htm#V12'>Hebrews 4:12</a>). Some beings may exist as spirits without necessarily having a visible body, such as angels and demons (<a href='LUK09.htm#V39'>Luke 9:39,</a> <a href='1JN04.htm#V1'>1 John 4:1-3</a>). </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>stadia</span> Stadia is plural for “stadion,” a linear measure of about 184.9 meters or 606.6 feet (the length of the race course at Olympia). </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>stater</span> A stater is a Greek silver coin equivalent to four Attic or two Alexandrian drachmas, or a Jewish shekel: just exactly enough to cover the half-shekel Temple Tax for two people. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>tabernacle</span> a dwelling place or place of worship, usually a tent. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>talent</span> A measure of weight or mass of 3000 shekels. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Tartarus</span> Tartarus is the Greek name for an underworld for the wicked dead; another name for Gehenna or Hell. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>teraphim</span> Teraphim are household idols that may have been associated with inheritance rights to the household property. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Yah</span> “Yah” is a shortened form of “Yahweh,” which is God’s proper name. This form is used occasionally in the Old Testament, mostly in the Psalms. See “Yahweh.” </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Yahweh</span> “Yahweh” is God’s proper name. In Hebrew, the four consonants roughly equivalent to YHWH were considered too holy to pronounce, so the Hebrew word for “Lord” (Adonai) was substituted when reading it aloud. When vowel points were added to the Hebrew Old Testament, the vowel points for “Adonai” were mixed with the consonants for “Yahweh,” which if you pronounced it literally as written, would be pronounced “Yehovah” or “Jehovah.” When the Old Testament was translated to Greek, the tradition of substituting “Lord” for God’s proper name continued in the translation of God’s name to “Lord” (Kurios). Some English Bibles translate God’s proper name to “LORD” or “GOD” (usually with small capital letters), based on that same tradition. This can get really confusing, since two other words (“Adonai” and “Elohim”) translate to “Lord” and “God,” and they are sometimes used together. The ASV of 1901 (and some other translations) render YHWH as “Jehovah.” The most probable pronunciation of God’s proper name is “Yahweh.” In Hebrew, the name “Yahweh” is related to the active declaration “I AM.” See <a href='EXO03.htm#V13'>Exodus 3:13-14</a>. Since Hebrew has no tenses, the declaration “I AM” can also be interpreted as “I WAS” and “I WILL BE.” Compare <a href='REV01.htm#V8'>Revelation 1:8</a>. </div><div class='ili'><span class='k'>Zion</span> Zion is a name which originally referred one of the mountains of Jerusalem. It became a term synonymous with Jerusalem itself. The term “Heavenly Zion” is also used to refer the future dwelling place of God’s people.
