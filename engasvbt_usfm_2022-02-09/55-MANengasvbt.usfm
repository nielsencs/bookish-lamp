\mt1 THE PRAYER OF MANASSEH 
\c 1  
\q1
\v 1 O Lord Almighty, that art in heaven, 
\q1 Thou God of our fathers, 
\q1 Of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, 
\q1 And of their righteous seed; 
\q1
\v 2 Who hast made heaven and earth, 
\q1 With all the ornament thereof; 
\q1
\v 3 Who hast bound the sea by the word of thy commandment; 
\q1 Who hast shut up the deep, 
\q1 And sealed it by thy terrible and glorious name; 
\q1
\v 4 Whom all things fear, 
\q1 Yea, tremble before thy power; 
\q1
\v 5 For the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, 
\q1 And the anger of thy threatening toward sinners is importable: 
\q1
\v 6 Thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable; 
\q1
\v 7 For thou art the Lord Most High, 
\q1 Of great compassion, long-suffering and abundant in mercy, 
\q1 And repentest of bringing evils upon men. 
\q1
\v 8 Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness 
\q1 Hast promised repentance and forgiveness 
\q1 To them that have sinned against thee: 
\q1 And of thine infinite mercies 
\q1 Hast appointed repentance unto sinners, 
\q1 That they may be saved. 
\q1 Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, 
\q1 Hast not appointed repentance to the just, 
\q1 To Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, who have not sinned against thee; 
\q1 But thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner: 
\q1
\v 9 For I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. 
\q1 My transgressions are multiplied, O Lord: my transgressions are multiplied, 
\q1 And I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven 
\q1 For the multitude of mine iniquities. 
\q1
\v 10 I am bowed down with many iron bands, 
\q1 That I cannot lift up my head by reason of my sins, 
\q1 Neither have I any respite: 
\q1 For I have provoked thy wrath, 
\q1 And done that which is evil before thee: 
\q1 I did not thy will, neither kept I thy commandments: 
\q1 I have set up abominations, and have multiplied detestable things. 
\q1
\v 11 Now therefore I bow the knee of my heart, 
\q1 Beseeching thee of grace. 
\q1
\v 12 I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, 
\q1 And I acknowledge mine iniquities: 
\q1
\v 13 But, I humbly beseech thee, 
\q1 Forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, 
\q1 And destroy me not with mine iniquities. 
\q1 Be not angry with me forever, by reserving evil for me; 
\q1 Neither condemn me into the lower parts of the earth. 
\q1 For thou, O Lord, art the God of them that repent; 
\q1
\v 14 And in me thou wilt show all thy goodness: 
\q1 For thou wilt save me, that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy. 
\q1
\v 15 And I will praise thee forever all the days of my life: 
\q1 For all the host of heaven doth sing thy praise, 
\q1 And thine is the glory forever and ever. Amen.
