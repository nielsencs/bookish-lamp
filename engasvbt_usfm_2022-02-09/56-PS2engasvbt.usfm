\mt1 PSALM 151 
\c 1  
\d This Psalm is a genuine one of David, though supernumerary, \add composed\add* when he fought in single combat with Goliath. 
\q1
\v 1 I was small among my brethren, 
\q1 And youngest in my father’s house: 
\q1 I tended my father’s sheep. 
\q1
\v 2 My hands formed a musical instrument, 
\q1 And my fingers tuned a psaltery. 
\q1
\v 3 And who shall tell my Lord? 
\q1 The Lord himself, he himself heareth. 
\q1
\v 4 He sent forth his angel, 
\q1 And took me from my father’s sheep, 
\q1 And he anointed me with the oil of his anointing. 
\q1
\v 5 My brethren were handsome and tall; 
\q1 But the Lord did not take pleasure in them. 
\q1
\v 6 I went forth to meet the Philistine; 
\q1 And he cursed me by his idols. 
\q1
\v 7 But I drew his own sword, and beheaded him, 
\q1 And removed reproach from the children of Israel.
