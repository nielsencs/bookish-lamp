\v 1 And Josiah held the Passover in Jerusalem unto his Lord, and offered the Passover the fourteenth day of the first month; 
\v 2 having set the priests according to their daily courses, being arrayed in their vestments, in the temple of the Lord. 
\v 3 And he spake unto the Levites, the temple servants of Israel, that they should hallow themselves unto the Lord, to set the holy ark of the Lord in the house that king Solomon the son of David had built: 
\v 4  \add and said,\add* Ye shall no more have need to bear it upon your shoulders: now therefore serve the Lord your God, and minister unto his people Israel, and prepare you after your fathers’ houses and kindreds, 
\v 5 according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the magnificence of Solomon his son: and standing in the holy place according to the several divisions of the families of you the Levites, who \add minister\add* in the presence of your brethren the children of Israel, 
\v 6 offer the Passover in order, and make ready the sacrifices for your brethren, and keep the Passover according to the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto Moses. 
\v 7 And unto the people who were present Josiah gave thirty thousand lambs and kids, \add and\add* three thousand calves: these things were given of the king’s substance, according as he promised, to the people, and to the priests and Levites. 
\v 8 And Hilkiah, and Zechariah, and Jehiel, the rulers of the temple, gave to the priests for the Passover two thousand \add and\add* six hundred sheep, \add and\add* three hundred calves. 
\v 9 And Jeconiah, and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brother, and Hashabiah, and Ochiel, and Joram, captains over thousands, gave to the Levites for the Passover five thousand sheep, \add and\add* seven hundred calves. 
\v 10 And when these things were done, the priests and Levites, having the unleavened bread, stood in comely order according to the kindreds, 
\v 11 and according to the several divisions by fathers’ houses, before the people, to offer to the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses: and thus \add did they\add* in the morning. 
\v 12 And they roasted the Passover with fire, as appertaineth: and the sacrifices they boiled in the brazen vessels and caldrons with a good savor, 
\v 13 and set them before all the people: and afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests their brethren, the sons of Aaron. 
\v 14 For the priests offered the fat until night: and the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests their brethren, the sons of Aaron. 
\v 15 The holy singers also, the sons of Asaph, were in their order, according to the appointment of David, \add to wit,\add* Asaph, Zechariah, and Eddinus, who was of the king’s retinue. 
\v 16 Moreover the porters were at every gate; none had need to depart from his daily course: for their brethren the Levites prepared for them. 
\v 17 Thus were the things that belonged to the sacrifices of the Lord accomplished in that day, in holding the Passover, 
\v 18 and offering sacrifices upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of king Josiah. 
\v 19 So the children of Israel who were present at that time held the Passover, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. 
\v 20 And such a Passover was not held in Israel since the time of the prophet Samuel. 
\v 21 Yea, all the kings of Israel held not such a Passover as Josiah, and the priests, and the Levites, and the Jews, held with all Israel that were present in their dwelling place at Jerusalem. 
\v 22 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover held. 
\v 23 And the works of Josiah were upright before his Lord with a heart full of godliness. 
\v 24 Moreover the things that came to pass in his days have been written in times past, concerning those that sinned, and did wickedly against the Lord above every people and kingdom, and how they grieved him exceedingly, so that the words of the Lord were confirmed against Israel. 
\p
\v 25 Now after all these acts of Josiah it came to pass, that Pharaoh the king of Egypt came to raise war at Carchemish upon Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him. 
\v 26 But the king of Egypt sent to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, O king of Judea? 
\v 27 I am not sent out from the Lord God against thee; for my war is upon Euphrates: and now the Lord is with me, yea, the Lord is with me hastening me forward: depart from me, and be not against the Lord. 
\v 28 Howbeit Josiah did not turn back unto his chariot, but undertook to fight with him, not regarding the words of the prophet Jeremiah \add spoken\add* by the mouth of the Lord: 
\v 29 but joined battle with him in the plain of Megiddo, and the princes came down against king Josiah. 
\v 30 Then said the king unto his servants, Carry me away out of the battle; for I am very weak. And immediately his servants carried him away out of the host. 
\v 31 Then gat he up upon his second chariot; and being brought back to Jerusalem he died, and was buried in the sepulcher of his fathers. 
\v 32 And in all Judea they mourned for Josiah; and Jeremiah the prophet lamented for Josiah, and the chief men with the women made lamentation for him, unto this day: and this was given out for an ordinance to be done continually in all the nation of Israel. 
\v 33 These things are written in the book of the histories of the kings of Judea, and every one of the acts that Josiah did, and his glory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord, and the things that he had done before, and the things now \add recited\add*, are reported in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
\p
\v 34 And the people took Joahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king instead of Josiah his father, when he was twenty and three years old. 
\v 35 And he reigned in Judah and in Jerusalem three months: and then the king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem. 
\v 36 And he set a tax upon the people of a hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold. 
\v 37 The king of Egypt also made king Jehoiakim his brother king of Judea and Jerusalem. 
\v 38 And Jehoiakim bound the nobles: but Zarius his brother he apprehended, and brought him up out of Egypt. 
\v 39 Five and twenty years old was Jehoiakim when he began to reign in Judea and Jerusalem; and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord. 
\v 40 And against him Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came up, and bound him with a chain of brass, and carried him unto Babylon. 
\v 41 Nebuchadnezzar also took of the holy vessels of the Lord, and carried them away, and set them up in his own temple at Babylon. 
\v 42 But those things that are reported of him, and of his uncleanness and impiety, are written in the chronicles of the kings. 
\v 43 And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead: for when he was made king he was eighteen years old; 
\v 44 and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and did that which was evil before the Lord. 
\p
\v 45 So after a year Nebuchadnezzar sent and caused him to be brought unto Babylon with the holy vessels of the Lord; 
\v 46 and made Zedekiah king of Judea and Jerusalem, when he was one and twenty years old; and he reigned eleven years: 
\v 47 and he also did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and cared not for the words that were spoken by Jeremiah the prophet from the mouth of the Lord. 
\v 48 And after that king Nebuchadnezzar had made him to swear by the name of the Lord, he forsware himself, and rebelled; and hardening his neck, and his heart, he transgressed the laws of the Lord, the God of Israel. 
\v 49 Moreover the governors of the people and of the priests did many things wickedly, and passed all the pollutions of all nations, and defiled the temple of the Lord, which was sanctified in Jerusalem. 
\v 50 And the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to call them back, because he had compassion on them and on his dwelling place. 
\v 51 But they mocked his messengers; and in the day when the Lord spake \add unto them,\add* they scoffed at his prophets: 
\v 52 so far forth, that he, being wroth with his people for their great ungodliness, commanded to bring up the kings of the Chaldeans against them; 
\v 53 who slew their young men with the sword, round about their holy temple, and spared neither young man nor maid, old man nor child; but he delivered all into their hands. 
\v 54 And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of the Lord, and the king’s treasures, and carried them away unto Babylon. 
\v 55 And they burnt the house of the Lord, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem, and burnt the towers thereof with fire: 
\v 56 and as for her glorious things, they never ceased till they had brought them all to nought: and the people that were not slain with the sword he carried unto Babylon: 
\v 57 and they were servants unto him and unto his children, till the Persians reigned, to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah: 
\v 58 Until the land hath enjoyed her Sabbaths, the whole time of her desolation shall she keep Sabbath, to fulfill threescore and ten years. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, 
\v 2 the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians, and he made proclamation through all his kingdom, and also by writing, 
\v 3 saying, Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians: The Lord of Israel, the Most High Lord, hath made me king of the whole world, 
\v 4 and commanded me to build him a house at Jerusalem that is in Judea. 
\v 5 If therefore there be any of you that are of his people, let the Lord, even his Lord, be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem that is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord of Israel: he is the Lord that dwelleth in Jerusalem. 
\v 6 Of such therefore as dwell in diverse places, let them that are in his own place help each one with gold, and with silver, 
\v 7 with gifts, with horses also and cattle, beside the other things which have been added by vow for the temple of the Lord which is in Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 8 Then the chief of the families of Judah and of the tribe of Benjamin stood up; the priests also, and the Levites, and all they whose spirit the Lord had stirred to go up, to build the house for the Lord which is in Jerusalem. 
\v 9 And they that dwelt round about them helped them in all things with silver and gold, with horses and cattle, and with very many gifts that were vowed of a great number whose minds were stirred up \add thereto.\add* 
\v 10 King Cyrus also brought forth the holy vessels of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem, and had set up in his temple of idols. 
\v 11 Now when Cyrus king of the Persians had brought them forth, he delivered them to Mithridates his treasurer, 
\v 12 and by him they were delivered to Sheshbazzar the governor of Judea. 
\v 13 And this was the number of them: A thousand golden cups, a thousand cups of silver, censers of silver twenty nine, vials of gold thirty, and of silver two thousand four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. 
\v 14 So all the vessels of gold and of silver were brought up, even five thousand four hundred threescore and nine, 
\v 15 and were carried back by Sheshbazzar, together with them of the captivity, from Babylon to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 16 But in the time of Artaxerxes king of the Persians Bislam, and Mithridates, and Tabeel, and Rehum, and Beltethmus, and Shimshai the scribe, with the others that were in commission with them, dwelling in Samaria and other places, wrote unto him against them that dwelt in Judea and Jerusalem the letter following: 
\v 17 To king Artaxerxes our Lord, Thy servants, Rehum the storywriter, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their council, and the judges that are in Coelesyria and Phoenicia: 
\v 18 Be it now known to our lord the king, that the Jews that are come up from you to us, being come unto Jerusalem, do build that rebellious and wicked city, and do repair the marketplaces and the walls of it, and do lay the foundation of a temple. 
\v 19 Now if this city be built and the walls \add thereof\add* be finished, they will not only refuse to give tribute, but will even stand up against kings. 
\v 20 And forasmuch as the things pertaining to the temple are now in hand, we think it meet not to neglect such a matter, 
\v 21 but to speak unto our lord the king, to the intent that, if it be thy pleasure, search may be made in the books of thy fathers: 
\v 22 and thou shalt find in the chronicles what is written concerning these things, and shalt understand that that city was rebellious, troubling both kings and cities: 
\v 23 and that the Jews were rebellious, and raised always wars therein of old time; for which cause even this city was laid waste. 
\v 24 Wherefore now we do declare unto thee, O lord the king, that if this city be built again, and the walls thereof set up anew, thou shalt from henceforth have no passage into Coelesyria and Phoenicia. 
\v 25 Then the king wrote back again to Rehum the storywriter, and Beltethmus, and Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest that were in commission, and dwelt in Samaria and Syria and Phoenicia, after this manner: 
\v 26 I have read the epistle which ye have sent unto me: therefore I commanded to make search, and it hath been found that that city of old time hath made insurrection against kings; 
\v 27 and the men were given to rebellion and war therein: and that mighty kings and fierce were in Jerusalem, who reigned and exacted tribute in Coelesyria and Phoenicia. 
\v 28 Now therefore I have commanded to hinder those men from building the city, and heed to be taken that there be nothing done contrary to this \add order;\add* 
\v 29 and that those wicked doings proceed no further to the annoyance of kings. 
\v 30 Then king Artaxerxes his letters being read, Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest that were in commission with them, removing in haste unto Jerusalem with horsemen and a multitude of people in battle array, began to hinder the builders; and the building of the temple in Jerusalem ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Now king Darius made a great feast unto all his subjects, and unto all that were born in his house, and unto all the princes of Media and of Persia, 
\v 2 and to all the satraps and captains and governors that were under him, from India unto Ethiopia, in the hundred twenty and seven provinces. 
\v 3 And when they had eaten and drunk, and being satisfied were gone home, then Darius the king went into his bedchamber, and slept, and awoke out of his sleep. 
\p
\v 4 Then the three young men of the bodyguard, that kept the king’s person, spake one to another: 
\v 5 Let every one of us say one thing which shall be strongest: and he whose sentence shall seem wiser than the others, unto him shall Darius the king give great gifts, and great honors in token of victory: 
\v 6 as, to be clothed in purple, to drink in gold, and to sleep upon gold, and a chariot with bridles of gold, and a headtire of fine linen, and a chain about his neck: 
\v 7 and he shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, and shall be called Darius his cousin. 
\v 8 And then they wrote every one his sentence, and set to their seals, and laid \add the writing\add* under king Darius his pillow, 
\v 9 and said, When the king is risen, some shall give him the writing; and of whose side the king and the three princes of Persia shall judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shall the victory be given, as it is written. 
\v 10 The first wrote, Wine is the strongest. 
\v 11 The second wrote, The king is strongest. 
\v 12 The third wrote, Women are strongest: but above all things Truth beareth away the victory. 
\p
\v 13 Now when the king was risen up, they took the writing, and gave it unto him, and so he read it: 
\v 14 and sending forth he called all the princes of Persia and of Media, and the satraps, and the captains, and the governors, and the chief officers; 
\v 15 and sat him down in the royal seat of judgment; and the writing was read before them. 
\v 16 And he said, Call the young men, and they shall explain their own sentences. So they were called, and came in. 
\v 17 And they said unto them, Declare unto us your mind concerning the things ye have written. 
\p Then began the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine, 
\v 18 and said thus, O sirs, how exceeding strong is wine! it causeth all men to err that drink it: 
\v 19 it maketh the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich: 
\v 20 it turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt: 
\v 21 and it maketh every heart rich, so that a man remembereth neither king nor satrap; and it maketh to speak all things by talents: 
\v 22 and when they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and brethren, and a little after draw their swords: 
\v 23 but when they awake from their wine, they remember not what they have done. 
\v 24 O sirs, is not wine the strongest, seeing that it forceth to do thus? And when he had so spoken, he held his peace. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 Then the second, that had spoken of the strength of the king, began to say, 
\v 2 O sirs, do not men excel in strength, that bear rule over the sea and land, and all things in them? 
\v 3 But yet is the king stronger: and he is their lord, and hath dominion over them; and in whatsoever he commandeth them they obey him. 
\v 4 If he bid them make war the one against the other, they do it: and if he send them out against the enemies, they go, and overcome mountains, walls, and towers. 
\v 5 They slay and are slain, and transgress not the king’s commandment: if they get the victory, they bring all to the king, as well the spoil, as all things else. 
\v 6 Likewise for those that are no soldiers, and have not to do with wars, but use husbandry, when they have reaped again that which they had sown, they bring it to the king, and compel one another to pay tribute unto the king. 
\v 7 And he is but one man: if he command to kill, they kill; if he command to spare, they spare; 
\v 8 if he command to smite, they smite; if he command to make desolate, they make desolate; if he command to build, they build; 
\v 9 if he command to cut down, they cut down; if he command to plant, they plant. 
\v 10 So all his people and his armies obey him: furthermore he lieth down, he eateth and drinketh, and taketh his rest: 
\v 11 and these keep watch round about him, neither may anyone depart, and do his own business, neither disobey they him \add in anything.\add* 
\v 12 O sirs, how should not the king be strongest, seeing that in such sort he is obeyed? And he held his peace. 
\p
\v 13 Then the third, who had spoken of women, and of truth, (this was Zerubbabel) began to speak. 
\v 14 O sirs, is not the king great, and men are many, and wine is strong? who is it then that ruleth them, or hath the lordship over them? are they not women? 
\v 15 Women have borne the king and all the people that bear rule by sea and land. 
\v 16 Even of them came they: and they nourished them up that planted the vineyards, from whence the wine cometh. 
\v 17 These also make garments for men; these bring glory unto men; and without women cannot men be. 
\v 18 Yea, and if men have gathered together gold and silver and any other goodly thing, and see a woman who is comely in favor and beauty, 
\v 19 they let all those things go, and gape after her, and even with open mouth fix their eyes fast on her; and have all more desire unto her than unto gold or silver, or any goodly thing whatsoever. 
\v 20 A man leaveth his own father that brought him up, and his own country, and cleaveth unto his wife. 
\v 21 And with his wife he endeth his days, and remembereth neither father, nor mother, nor country. 
\v 22 By this also ye must know that women have dominion over you: do ye not labor and toil, and give and bring all to women? 
\v 23 Yea, a man taketh his sword, and goeth forth to make outroads, and to rob and to steal, and to sail upon the sea and upon rivers; 
\v 24 and looketh upon a lion, and walketh in the darkness; and when he hath stolen, plundered, and robbed, he bringeth it to his love. 
\v 25 Wherefore a man loveth his wife better than father or mother. 
\v 26 Yea, many there are that have run out of their wits for women, and become bondmen for their sakes. 
\v 27 Many also have perished, have stumbled, and sinned, for women. 
\v 28 And now do ye not believe me? is not the king great in his power? do not all regions fear to touch him? 
\v 29 Yet did I see him and Apame the king’s concubine, the daughter of the illustrious Bartacus, sitting at the right hand of the king, 
\v 30 and taking the crown from the king’s head, and setting it upon her own head; yea, she struck the king with her left hand: 
\v 31 and therewithal the king gaped and gazed upon her with open mouth: if she laughed upon him, he laughed also: but if she took any displeasure at him, he was fain to flatter, that she might be reconciled to him again. 
\v 32 O sirs, how can it be but women should be strong, seeing they do thus? 
\p
\v 33 Then the king and the nobles looked one upon another: so he began to speak concerning truth. 
\v 34 O sirs, are not women strong? great is the earth, high is the heaven, swift is the sun in its course, for it compasseth the heavens round about, and fetcheth its course again to its own place in one day. 
\v 35 Is he not great that maketh these things? therefore great is truth, and stronger than all things. 
\v 36 All the earth calleth upon truth, and the heaven blesseth her: all works shake and tremble, but with her is no unrighteous thing. 
\v 37 Wine is unrighteous, the king is unrighteous, women are unrighteous, all the children of men are unrighteous, and unrighteous are all such their works; and there is no truth in them; in their unrighteousness also they shall perish. 
\v 38 But truth abideth, and is strong forever; she liveth and conquereth forevermore. 
\v 39 With her there is no accepting of persons or rewards; but she doeth the things that are just, \add and refraineth\add* from all unrighteous and wicked things; and all men do well like of her works. 
\v 40 Neither in her judgment is any unrighteousness; and she is the strength, and the kingdom, and the power, and the majesty, of all ages. Blessed be the God of truth. 
\v 41 And with that he held his tongue. And all the people then shouted, and said, Great is truth, and strong above all things. 
\p
\v 42 Then said the king unto him, Ask what thou wilt more than is appointed in writing, and we will give it thee, inasmuch as thou art found wisest; and thou shalt sit next me, and shalt be called my cousin. 
\v 43 Then said he unto the king, Remember thy vow, which thou didst vow to build Jerusalem, in the day when thou camest to thy kingdom, 
\v 44 and to send away all the vessels that were taken out of Jerusalem, which Cyrus set apart, when he vowed to destroy Babylon, and vowed to send them again thither. 
\v 45 Thou didst also vow to build up the temple, which the Edomites burned when Judea was made desolate by the Chaldeans. 
\v 46 And now, O lord the king, this is that which I require, and which I desire of thee, and this is the princely liberality that shall proceed from thee: I pray therefore that thou make good the vow, the performance whereof thou hast vowed to the King of heaven with thine own mouth. 
\p
\v 47 Then Darius the king stood up, and kissed him, and wrote letters for him unto all the treasurers and governors and captains and satraps, that they should safely bring on their way both him, and all those that should go up with him to build Jerusalem. 
\v 48 He wrote letters also unto all the governors that were in Coelesyria and Phoenicia, and unto them in Lebanon, that they should bring cedar wood from Lebanon unto Jerusalem, and that they should build the city with him. 
\v 49 Moreover he wrote for all the Jews that should go out of his realm up into Judea, concerning their freedom, that no officer, no governor, no satrap, nor treasurer, should forcibly enter into their doors; 
\v 50 and that all the country which they occupied should be free to them without tribute; and that the Edomites should give over the villages of the Jews which then they held: 
\v 51 and that there should be yearly given twenty talents to the building of the temple, until the time that it were built; 
\v 52 and other ten talents yearly, for burnt offerings to be presented upon the altar every day, as they had a commandment to offer seventeen: 
\v 53 and that all they that should come from Babylonia to build the city should have their freedom, as well they as their posterity, and all the priests that came. 
\v 54 He wrote also \add to give them\add* their charges, and the priests’ vestments wherein they minister; 
\v 55 and for the Levites he wrote that their charges should be given them until the day that the house were finished, and Jerusalem built up. 
\v 56 And he commanded to give to all that kept the city lands and wages. 
\v 57 He sent away also all the vessels from Babylon, that Cyrus had set apart; and all that Cyrus had given in commandment, the same charged he also to be done, and sent unto Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 58 Now when this young man was gone forth, he lifted up his face to heaven toward Jerusalem, and praised the King of heaven, 
\v 59 and said, From thee cometh victory, from thee cometh wisdom, and thine is the glory, and I am thy servant. 
\v 60 Blessed art thou, who hast given me wisdom: and to thee I give thanks, O Lord of our fathers. 
\v 61 And so he took the letters, and went out, and came unto Babylon, and told it all his brethren. 
\v 62 And they praised the God of their fathers, because he had given them freedom and liberty 
\v 63 to go up, and to build Jerusalem, and the temple which is called by his name: and they feasted with instruments of music and gladness seven days. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 After this were the chiefs of fathers’ houses chosen to go up according to their tribes, with their wives and sons and daughters, with their menservants and maidservants, and their cattle. 
\v 2 And Darius sent with them a thousand horsemen, till they had brought them back to Jerusalem safely, and with musical instruments, tabrets and flutes. 
\v 3 And all their brethren played, and he made them go up together with them. 
\p
\v 4 And these are the names of the men who went up, according to their families among their tribes, after their several divisions. 
\v 5 The priests, the sons of Phinehas, the sons of Aaron: Jeshua the son of Jozadak, the son of Seraiah, and Joakim the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, of the house of David, of the lineage of Phares, of the tribe of Judah; 
\v 6 who spake wise sentences before Darius the king of Persia in the second year of his reign, in the month Nisan, which is the first month. 
\v 7 And these are they of Judea that came up from the captivity, where they dwelt as strangers, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon. 
\v 8 And they returned unto Jerusalem, and to the other parts of Judea, every man to his own city, who came with Zerubbabel, with Jeshua, Nehemiah, \add and\add* Seraiah, Resaiah, Eneneus, Mordecai, Beelsarus, Aspharsus, Reeliah, Roimus, \add and\add* Baana, their leaders. 
\v 9 The number of them of the nation, and their leaders: the sons of Parosh, two thousand a hundred seventy and two: the sons of Shephatiah, four hundred seventy and two: 
\v 10 the sons of Arah, seven hundred fifty and six: 
\v 11 the sons of Pahath-moab, of the sons of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred and twelve: 
\v 12 the sons of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four: the sons of Zattu, nine hundred forty and five: the sons of Chorbe, seven hundred and five: the sons of Bani, six hundred forty and eight: 
\v 13 the sons of Bebai, six hundred twenty and three: the sons of Azgad, a thousand three hundred twenty and two: 
\v 14 the sons of Adonikam, six hundred sixty and seven: the sons of Bigvai, two thousand sixty and six: the sons of Adin, four hundred fifty and four: 
\v 15 the sons of Ater, of Hezekiah, ninety and two: the sons of Kilan and Azetas, threescore and seven: the sons of Azaru, four hundred thirty and two: 
\v 16 the sons of Annias, a hundred and one: the sons of Arom: the sons of Bezai, three hundred twenty and three: the sons of Arsiphurith, a hundred and twelve: 
\v 17 the sons of Baiterus, three thousand and five: the sons of Bethlehem, a hundred twenty and three: 
\v 18 they of Netophah, fifty and five: they of Anathoth, a hundred fifty and eight: they of Bethasmoth, forty and two: 
\v 19 they of Kiriath-arim, twenty and five: they of Chephirah and Beeroth, seven hundred forty and three: 
\v 20 the Chadiasans and Ammidians, four hundred twenty and two: they of Kirama and Geba, six hundred twenty and one: 
\v 21 they of Macalon, a hundred twenty and two: they of Betolio, fifty and two: the sons of Niphish, a hundred fifty and six: 
\v 22 the sons of Calamolalus and Ono, seven hundred twenty and five: the sons of Jerechus, three hundred forty and five: 
\v 23 the sons of Senaah, three thousand three hundred and thirty. 
\v 24 The priests: the sons of Jedaiah, the son of Jeshua, among the sons of Anasib, nine hundred seventy and two: the sons of Immer, a thousand fifty and two: 
\v 25 the sons of Pashhur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven: the sons of Harim, a thousand and seventeen. 
\v 26 The Levites: the sons of Jeshua, and Kadmiel, and Bannas, and Sudias, seventy and four. 
\v 27 The holy singers: the sons of Asaph, a hundred twenty and eight. 
\v 28 The porters: the sons of Shallum, the sons of Ater, the sons of Talmon, the sons of Akkub, the sons of Hatita, the sons of Shobai, in all a hundred thirty and nine. 
\v 29 The temple servants: the sons of Esau, the sons of Hasupha, the sons of Tabbaoth, the sons of Keros, the sons of Sua, the sons of Padon, the sons of Lebanah, the sons of Hagabah, 
\v 30 the sons of Akkub, the sons of Uthai, the sons of Ketab, the sons of Hagab, the sons of Subai, the sons of Hana, the sons of Cathua, the sons of Geddur, 
\v 31 the sons of Jairus, the sons of Daisan, the sons of Noeba, the sons of Chezib, the sons of Gazera, the sons of Uzza, the sons of Phinoe, the sons of Hasrah, the sons of Basthai, the sons of Asnah, the sons of Maani, the sons of Nephisim, the sons of Acuph, the sons of Hakupha, the sons of Asur, the sons of Pharakim, the sons of Bazluth, 
\v 32 the sons of Mehida, the sons of Cutha, the sons of Charea, the sons of Barkos, the sons of Serar, the sons of Temah, the sons of Neziah, the sons of Hatipha. 
\v 33 The sons of the servants of Solomon: the sons of Assaphioth, the sons of Peruda, the sons of Jaalah, the sons of Lozon, the sons of Isdael, the sons of Shephatiah, 
\v 34 the sons of Agia, the sons of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the sons of Sarothie, the sons of Masiah, the sons of Gas, the sons of Addus, the sons of Subas, the sons of Apherra, the sons of Barodis, the sons of Shaphat, the sons of Allon. 
\v 35 All the temple servants, and the sons of the servants of Solomon, were three hundred seventy and two. 
\v 36 These came up from Tel-melah, and Tel-harsha, Cherub leading them, and Addan, and Immer; 
\v 37 and they could not show their families, nor their stock, how they were of Israel: the sons of Delaiah the son of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two. 
\v 38 And of the priests, they that usurped the office of the priesthood and were not found: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Jaddus, who married Agia one of the daughters of Barzillai, and was called after his name. 
\v 39 And when the description of the kindred of these men was sought in the register, and was not found, they were removed from executing the office of the priesthood: 
\v 40 for unto them said Nehemiah and Attharias, that they should not be partakers of the holy things, till there arose up a high priest wearing Urim and Thummim. 
\v 41 So all they of Israel, from twelve years old \add and upward,\add* beside menservants and maidservants, were \add in number\add* forty and two thousand three hundred and sixty. 
\v 42 Their menservants and maidservants were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: the minstrels and singers, two hundred forty and five: 
\v 43 four hundred thirty and five camels, seven thousand thirty and six horses, two hundred forty and five mules, five thousand five hundred twenty and five beasts of burden. 
\v 44 And certain of the chief men of their families, when they came to the temple of God that is in Jerusalem, vowed to set up the house again in its own place according to their ability, 
\v 45 and to give into the holy treasury of the works a thousand pounds of gold, five thousand of silver, and a hundred priestly vestments. 
\v 46 And the priests and the Levites and they that were of the people dwelt in Jerusalem and the country; the holy singers also and the porters and all Israel in their villages. 
\p
\v 47 But when the seventh month was at hand, and when the children of Israel were every man in his own place, they came all together with one consent into the broad place before the first porch which is toward the east. 
\v 48 Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and made ready the altar of the God of Israel, 
\v 49 to offer burnt sacrifices upon it, according as it is expressly commanded in the book of Moses the man of God. 
\v 50 And certain were gathered unto them out of the other nations of the land, and they erected the altar upon its own place, because all the nations of the land were at enmity with them, and oppressed them; and they offered sacrifices according to the time, and burnt offerings to the Lord both morning and evening. 
\v 51 Also they held the feast of tabernacles, as it is commanded in the law, and \add offered\add* sacrifices daily, as was meet: 
\v 52 and after that, the continual oblations, and the sacrifices of the Sabbaths, and of the new moons, and of all the consecrated feasts. 
\v 53 And all they that had made any vow to God began to offer sacrifices to God from the new moon of the seventh month, although the temple of God was not yet built. 
\v 54 And they gave money unto the masons and carpenters; and meat and drink, 
\v 55 and carts unto them of Sidon and Tyre, that they should bring cedar trees from Lebanon, \add and\add* convey them in floats to the haven of Joppa, according to the commandment which was written for them by Cyrus king of the Persians. 
\v 56 And in the second year after his coming to the temple of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and their brethren, and the priests the Levites, and all they that were come unto Jerusalem out of the captivity: 
\v 57 and they laid the foundation of the temple of God on the new moon of the second month, in the second year after they were come to Judea and Jerusalem. 
\v 58 And they appointed the Levites from twenty years old over the works of the Lord. Then stood up Jeshua, and his sons and brethren, and Kadmiel his brother, and the sons of Jeshua Emadabun, and the sons of Joda the son of Iliadun, and their sons and brethren, all the Levites, with one accord setters forward of the business, laboring to advance the works in the house of God. So the builders built the temple of the Lord. 
\v 59 And the priests stood arrayed in their vestments with musical instruments and trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with their cymbals, 
\v 60 singing songs of thanksgiving, and praising the Lord, after the order of David king of Israel. 
\v 61 And they sang aloud, praising the Lord in songs of thanksgiving, because his goodness and his glory are forever in all Israel. 
\v 62 And all the people sounded trumpets, and shouted with a loud voice, singing songs of thanksgiving unto the Lord for the rearing up of the house of the Lord. 
\v 63 Also of the priests the Levites, and of the heads of their families, the ancients who had seen the former house came to the building of this with lamentation and great weeping. 
\v 64 But many with trumpets and joy \add shouted\add* with loud voice, 
\v 65 insomuch that the people heard not the trumpets for the weeping of the people: for the multitude sounded marvelously, so that it was heard afar off. 
\p
\v 66 Wherefore when the enemies of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin heard it, they came to know what that noise of trumpets should mean. 
\v 67 And they perceived that they that were of the captivity did build the temple unto the Lord, the God of Israel. 
\v 68 So they went to Zerubbabel and Jeshua, and to the chief men of the families, and said unto them, we will build together with you. 
\v 69 For we likewise, as ye, do obey your Lord, and do sacrifice unto him from the days of Esar-haddon the king of the Assyrians, who brought us hither. 
\v 70 Then Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the chief men of the families of Israel said unto them, It is not for you to build the house unto the Lord our God. 
\v 71 We ourselves alone will build unto the Lord of Israel, according as Cyrus the king of the Persians hath commanded us. 
\v 72 But the heathen of the land lying heavy upon the inhabitants of Judea, and holding them strait, hindered their building; 
\v 73 and by their secret plots, and popular persuasions and commotions, they hindered the finishing of the building all the time that king Cyrus lived: so they were hindered from building for the space of two years, until the reign of Darius. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Now in the second year of the reign of Darius, Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo, the prophets, prophesied unto the Jews in Judea and Jerusalem; in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, \add prophesied they\add* unto them. 
\v 2 Then stood up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, the prophets of the Lord being with them, \add and\add* helping them. 
\v 3 At the same time came unto them Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phoenicia, with Sathrabuzanes and his companions, and said unto them, 
\v 4 By whose appointment do ye build this house and this roof, and perform all the other things? and who are the builders that perform these things? 
\v 5 Nevertheless the elders of the Jews obtained favor, because the Lord had visited the captivity; 
\v 6 and they were not hindered from building, until such time as communication was made unto Darius concerning them, and his answer signified. 
\p
\v 7 The copy of the letter which Sisinnes, governor of Syria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, with their companions, the rulers in Syria and Phoenicia, wrote and sent unto Darius: 
\v 8 To king Darius, greeting: Let all things be known unto our lord the king, that being come into the country of Judea, and entered into the city of Jerusalem, we found in the city of Jerusalem the elders of the Jews that were of the captivity 
\v 9 building a house unto the Lord, great \add and\add* new, of hewn and costly stones, with timber laid in the walls. 
\v 10 And those works are done with great speed, and the work goeth on prosperously in their hands, and with all glory and diligence it is accomplished. 
\v 11 Then asked we these elders, saying, By whose commandment build ye this house, and lay the foundations of these works? 
\v 12 Therefore, to the intent that we might give knowledge unto thee by writing who were the chief doers, we questioned them, and we required of them the names in writing of their principal men. 
\v 13 So they gave us this answer, We are the servants of the Lord who made heaven and earth. 
\v 14 And as for this house, it was built many years ago by a king of Israel great and strong, and was finished. 
\v 15 But when our fathers sinned against the Lord of Israel who is in heaven, and provoked him unto wrath, he gave them over into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of the Chaldeans; 
\v 16 and they pulled down the house, and burned it, and carried away the people captives unto Babylon. 
\v 17 But in the first year that Cyrus reigned over the country of Babylon, king Cyrus wrote to build up this house. 
\v 18 And the holy vessels of gold and of silver, that Nebuchadnezzar had carried away out of the house at Jerusalem, and had set up in his own temple, those Cyrus the king brought forth again out of the temple in Babylonia, and they were delivered to Zerubbabel and to Sheshbazzar the governor, 
\v 19 with commandment that he should carry away all these vessels, and put them in the temple at Jerusalem; and that the temple of the Lord should be built in its place. 
\v 20 Then Sheshbazzar, being come hither, laid the foundations of the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem; and from that time to this being still in process of building, it is not yet fully ended. 
\v 21 Now therefore, if it seem good, O king, let search be made among the royal archives of our lord the king that are in Babylon: 
\v 22 and if it be found that the building of the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem hath been done with the consent of king Cyrus, and it seem good unto our lord the king, let him signify unto us thereof. 
\p
\v 23 Then commanded king Darius to seek among the archives that were laid up at Babylon: and so at Ecbatana the palace, which is in the country of Media, there was found a roll wherein these things were recorded. 
\v 24 In the first year of the reign of Cyrus king Cyrus commanded to build up the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem, where they do sacrifice with continual fire: 
\v 25 whose height shall be sixty cubits, and the breadth sixty cubits, with three rows of hewn stones, and one row of new wood of that country; and the expenses thereof to be given out of the house of king Cyrus: 
\v 26 and that the holy vessels of the house of the Lord, both gold and silver, that Nebuchadnezzar took out of the house at Jerusalem, and carried away to Babylon, should be restored to the house at Jerusalem, and be set in the place where they were before. 
\v 27 And also he commanded that Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, and their companions, and those who were appointed rulers in Syria and Phoenicia, should be careful not to meddle with the place, but suffer Zerubbabel, the servant of the Lord, and governor of Judea, and the elders of the Jews, to build that house of the Lord in its place. 
\v 28 And I also do command to have it built up whole again; and that they look diligently to help those that are of the captivity of Judea, till the house of the Lord be finished: 
\v 29 and that out of the tribute of Coelesyria and Phoenicia a portion be carefully given these men for the sacrifices of the Lord, \add that is,\add* to Zerubbabel the governor, for bullocks, and rams, and lambs; 
\v 30 and also grain, salt, wine and oil, and that continually every year without further question, according as the priests that are in Jerusalem shall signify to be daily spent: 
\v 31 that drink offerings may be made to the Most High God for the king and for his children, and that they may pray for their lives. 
\v 32 And that commandment be given that whosoever shall transgress, yea, or neglect anything \add herein\add* written, out of his own \add house\add* shall a tree be taken, and he thereon be hanged, and all his goods seized for the king. 
\v 33 The Lord therefore, whose name is there called upon, utterly destroy every king and nation, that shall stretch out his hand to hinder or damage that house of the Lord in Jerusalem. 
\v 34 I Darius the king have ordained that according unto these things it be done with diligence. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 Then Sisinnes the governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, with their companions, following the commandments of king Darius, 
\v 2 did very carefully oversee the holy works, assisting the elders of the Jews and rulers of the temple. 
\v 3 And so the holy works prospered, while Haggai and Zechariah the prophets prophesied. 
\v 4 And they finished these things by the commandment of the Lord, the God of Israel, and with the consent of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of the Persians. 
\v 5  \add And thus\add* was the house finished by the three and twentieth day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of king Darius. 
\v 6 And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the other that were of the captivity, that were added \add unto them,\add* did according to the things \add written\add* in the book of Moses. 
\v 7 And to the dedication of the temple of the Lord they offered a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; 
\v 8  \add and\add* twelve he-goats for the sin of all Israel, according to the number of the twelve princes of the tribes of Israel. 
\v 9 The priests also and the Levites stood arrayed in their vestments, according to their kindreds, for the services of the Lord, the God of Israel, according to the book of Moses: and the porters at every gate. 
\p
\v 10 And the children of Israel that came out of the captivity held the Passover the fourteenth day of the first month, when the priests and the Levites were sanctified together, 
\v 11 and all they that were of the captivity; for they were sanctified. For the Levites were all sanctified together, 
\v 12 and they offered the Passover for all them of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. 
\v 13 And the children of Israel that came out of the captivity did eat, even all they that had separated themselves from the abominations of the heathen of the land, and sought the Lord. 
\v 14 And they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days, making merry before the Lord, 
\v 15 for that he had turned the counsel of the king of Assyria toward them, to strengthen their hands in the works of the Lord, the God of Israel. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 And after these things, when Artaxerxes the king of the Persians reigned, came Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, the son of Shallum, 
\v 2 the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, the son of Amariah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the chief priest. 
\v 3 This Ezra went up from Babylon, as being a ready scribe in the law of Moses, that was given by the God of Israel. 
\v 4 And the king did him honor: for he found grace in his sight in all his requests. 
\v 5 There went up with him also certain of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and Levites, and holy singers, and porters, and temple servants, unto Jerusalem, 
\v 6 in the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes, in the fifth month, this was the king’s seventh year; for they went from Babylon on the new moon of the first month, and came to Jerusalem, according to the prosperous journey which the Lord gave them for his sake. 
\v 7 For Ezra had very great skill, so that he omitted nothing of the law and commandments of the Lord, \add but\add* taught all Israel the ordinances and judgments. 
\p
\v 8 Now the commission, which was written from Artaxerxes the king, came to Ezra the priest and reader of the law of the Lord, whereof this that followeth is a copy: 
\v 9 King Artaxerxes unto Ezra the priest and reader of the law of the Lord, greeting: 
\v 10 Having determined to deal graciously, I have given order, that such of the nation of the Jews, and of the priests and Levites, and of those within our realm, as are willing and desirous, should go with thee unto Jerusalem. 
\v 11 As many therefore as have a mind \add thereunto,\add* let them depart with thee, as it hath seemed good both to me and my seven friends the counselors; 
\v 12 that they may look unto the affairs of Judea and Jerusalem, agreeably to that which is in the law of the Lord, 
\v 13 and carry the gifts unto the Lord of Israel to Jerusalem, which I and my friends have vowed; and that all the gold and silver that can be found in the country of Babylonia for the Lord in Jerusalem, 
\v 14 with that also which is given of the people for the temple of the Lord their God that is at Jerusalem, be collected: even the gold and silver for bullocks, rams, and lambs, and things thereunto appertaining; 
\v 15 to the end that they may offer sacrifices unto the Lord upon the altar of the Lord their God, which is in Jerusalem. 
\v 16 And whatsoever thou and thy brethren are minded to do with gold and silver, that perform, according to the will of thy God. 
\v 17 And the holy vessels of the Lord, which are given thee for the use of the temple of thy God, which is in Jerusalem: 
\v 18 and whatsoever thing else thou shalt remember for the use of the temple of thy God, thou shalt give it out of the king’s treasury. 
\v 19 And I king Artaxerxes have also commanded the keepers of the treasures in Syria and Phoenicia, that whatsoever Ezra the priest and reader of the law of the Most High God shall send for, they should give it him with all diligence, 
\v 20 to the sum of a hundred talents of silver, likewise also of wheat even to a hundred measures, and a hundred firkins of wine, and salt in abundance. 
\v 21 Let all things be performed after the law of God diligently unto the most high God, that wrath come not upon the kingdom of the king and his sons. 
\v 22 I command you also, that no tax, nor any other imposition, be laid upon any of the priests, or Levites, or holy singers, or porters, or temple servants, or any that have employment in this temple, and that no man have authority to impose anything upon them. 
\v 23 And thou, Ezra, according to the wisdom of God ordain judges and justices, that they may judge in all Syria and Phoenicia all those that know the law of thy God; and those that know it not thou shalt teach. 
\v 24 And whosoever shall transgress the law of thy God, and of the king, shall be punished diligently, whether it be by death, or other punishment, by penalty of money, or by imprisonment. 
\p
\v 25 Then said Ezra the scribe, Blessed be the only Lord, the God of my fathers, who hath put these things into the heart of the king, to glorify his house that is in Jerusalem: 
\v 26 and hath honored me in the sight of the king, and his counselors, and all his friends and nobles. 
\v 27 Therefore was I encouraged by the help of the Lord my God, and gathered together out of Israel men to go up with me. 
\v 28 And these are the chief according to their families and the several divisions thereof, that went up with me from Babylon in the reign of king Artaxerxes: 
\v 29 of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar, Gamael: of the sons of David, Hattush the son of Shecaniah: 
\v 30 of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and with him were counted a hundred and fifty men: 
\v 31 of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred men: 
\v 32 of the sons of Zattu, Shecaniah the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred men: of the sons of Adin, Obed the son of Jonathan, and with him two hundred and fifty men: 
\v 33 of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Gotholiah, and with him seventy men: 
\v 34 of the sons of Shephatiah, Zeraiah son of Michael, and with him threescore and ten men: 
\v 35 of the sons of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and twelve men: 
\v 36 of the sons of Bani, Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him a hundred and threescore men: 
\v 37 of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight men: 
\v 38 of the sons of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him a hundred and ten men: 
\v 39 of the sons of Adonikam, the last, and these are the names of them, Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, and with them seventy men: 
\v 40 of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai the son of Istalcurus, and with him seventy men. 
\p
\v 41 And I gathered them together to the river called Theras; and there we pitched our tents three days, and I surveyed them. 
\v 42 But when I had found there none of the priests and Levites, 
\v 43 then sent I unto Eleazar, and Iduel, and Maasmas, 
\v 44 and Elnathan, and Shemaiah, and Jarib, Nathan, Elnathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, principal men and men of understanding. 
\v 45 And I bade them that they should go unto Iddo the captain, who was in the place of the treasury: 
\v 46 and commanded them that they should speak unto Iddo, and to his brethren, and to the treasurers in that place, to send us such men as might execute the priests’ office in the house of our Lord. 
\v 47 And by the mighty hand of our Lord they brought unto us men of understanding of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, the son of Israel, Sherebiah, and his sons, and his brethren, who were eighteen, 
\v 48 and Hashabiah, and Annunus, and Jeshaiah his brother, of the sons of Hananiah, and their sons were twenty men; 
\v 49 and of the temple servants whom David and the principal men had appointed for the servants of the Levites, two hundred and twenty temple servants, the catalogue of all their names was shown. 
\v 50 And there I vowed a fast for the young men before our Lord, to desire of him a prosperous journey both for us and for our children and cattle that were with us: 
\v 51 for I was ashamed to ask of the king footmen, and horsemen, and conduct for safeguard against our adversaries. 
\v 52 For we had said unto the king, that the power of our Lord would be with them that seek him, to support them in all ways. 
\v 53 And again we besought our lord as touching these things, and found him favorable \add unto us.\add* 
\v 54 Then I separated twelve men of the chiefs of the priests, Sherebiah, and Hashabiah, and ten men of their brethren with them: 
\v 55 and I weighed them the silver, and the gold, and the holy vessels of the house of our Lord, which the king, and his counselors, and the nobles, and all Israel, had given. 
\v 56 And when I had weighed it, I delivered unto them six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels of a hundred talents, and a hundred talents of gold, 
\v 57 and twenty golden vessels, and twelve vessels of brass, even of fine brass, glittering like gold. 
\v 58 And I said unto them, Both ye are holy unto the Lord, and the vessels are holy, and the gold and the silver are a vow unto the Lord, the Lord of our fathers. 
\v 59 Watch ye, and keep them till ye deliver them to the chiefs of the priests and Levites, and to the principal men of the families of Israel, in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of our Lord. 
\v 60 So the priests and the Levites, who received the silver and the gold and the vessels which were in Jerusalem, brought them into the temple of the Lord. 
\p
\v 61 And from the river Theras we departed the twelfth day of the first month, until we came to Jerusalem, by the mighty hand of our Lord which was upon us: and the Lord delivered us from \add assault by\add* the way, from every enemy, and so we came to Jerusalem. 
\v 62 And when we had been there three days, the silver and gold was weighed and delivered in the house of our Lord on the fourth day unto Meremoth the priest the son of Uriah. 
\v 63 And with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas, and with them were Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Moeth the son of Binnui, the Levites: all \add was delivered them\add* by number and weight. 
\v 64 And all the weight of them was written up the same hour. 
\v 65 Moreover they that were come out of the captivity offered sacrifices unto the Lord, the God of Israel, even twelve bullocks for all Israel, fourscore and sixteen rams, 
\v 66 threescore and twelve lambs, goats for a peace offering, twelve; all of them a sacrifice to the Lord. 
\v 67 And they delivered the king’s commandments unto the king’s stewards, and to the governors of Coelesyria and Phoenicia; and they honored the people and the temple of the Lord. 
\p
\v 68 Now when these things were done, the principal men came unto me, and said, 
\v 69 The nation of Israel, and the princes, and the priests and the Levites, have not put away \add from them\add* the strange people of the land, nor the uncleannesses of the Gentiles, \add to wit,\add* of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and the Moabites, Egyptians, and Edomites. 
\v 70 For both they and their sons have married with their daughters, and the holy seed is mixed with the strange people of the land; and from the beginning of this matter the rulers and the nobles have been partakers of this iniquity. 
\v 71 And as soon as I had heard these things, I rent my clothes, and my holy garment, and plucked the hair from off my head and beard, and sat me down sad and full of heaviness. 
\v 72 So all they that were moved at the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, assembled unto me, while I mourned for the iniquity: but I sat still full of heaviness until the evening sacrifice. 
\v 73 Then rising up from the fast with my clothes and my holy garment rent, and bowing my knees, and stretching forth my hands unto the Lord, 
\v 74 I said, O Lord, I am ashamed and confounded before thy face; 
\v 75 for our sins are multiplied above our heads, and our errors have reached up unto heaven, 
\v 76 ever since the time of our fathers; and we are in great sin, even unto this day. 
\v 77 And for our sins and our fathers’ we with our brethren and our kings and our priests were given up to the kings of the earth, to the sword, and to captivity, and for a prey with shame, unto this day. 
\v 78 And now in some measure hath mercy been shown unto us from thee, O Lord, that there should be left us a root and a name in the place of thy sanctuary; 
\v 79 and to discover unto us a light in the house of the Lord our God, \add and\add* to give us food in the time of our servitude. 
\v 80 Yea, when we were in bondage, we were not forsaken of our Lord; but he made us gracious before the kings of Persia, so that they gave us food, 
\v 81 and glorified the temple of our Lord, and raised up the desolate Zion, to give us a sure abiding in Judea and Jerusalem. 
\v 82 And now, O Lord, what shall we say, having these things? For we have transgressed thy commandments, which thou gavest by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying, 
\v 83 That the land, which ye enter into to possess as a heritage, is a land polluted with the pollutions of the strangers of the land, and they have filled it with their uncleanness. 
\v 84 Therefore now shall ye not join your daughters unto their sons, neither shall ye take their daughters unto your sons. 
\v 85 Neither shall ye seek to have peace with them forever, that ye may be strong, and eat the good things of the land, and that ye may leave it for an inheritance unto your children forevermore. 
\v 86 And all that is befallen is done unto us for our wicked works and great sins: for thou, O Lord, didst make our sins light, 
\v 87 and didst give unto us such a root: \add but\add* we have turned back again to transgress thy law, in mingling ourselves with the uncleanness of the heathen of the land. 
\v 88 Thou wast not angry with us to destroy us, till thou hadst left us neither root, seed, nor name. 
\v 89 O Lord of Israel, thou art true: for we are left a root this day. 
\v 90 Behold, now are we before thee in our iniquities, for we cannot stand any longer before thee by reason of these things. 
\p
\v 91 And as Ezra in his prayer made his confession, weeping, and lying flat upon the ground before the temple, there gathered unto him from Jerusalem a very great throng of men and women and children: for there was great weeping among the multitude. 
\v 92 Then Jeconiah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Israel, called out, and said, O Ezra, we have sinned against the Lord God, we have married strange women of the heathen of the land, and now is all Israel aloft. 
\v 93 Let us make an oath unto the Lord herein, that we will put away all our wives, whom \add we have taken\add* of the strangers, with their children, 
\v 94 like as seemeth good unto thee, and to as many as do obey the law of the Lord. 
\v 95 Arise, and put in execution: for to thee doth this matter appertain, and we will be with thee to do valiantly. 
\v 96 So Ezra arose, and took an oath of the chief of the priests and Levites of all Israel to do after these things; and \add so\add* they sware. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 Then Ezra rising from the court of the temple went to the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib, 
\v 2 and lodged there, and did eat no bread nor drink water, mourning for the great iniquities of the multitude. 
\v 3 And there was made proclamation in all Judea and Jerusalem to all them that were of the captivity, that they should be gathered together at Jerusalem: 
\v 4 and that whosoever met not there within two or three days, according as the elders that bare rule appointed, their cattle should be seized to the use of the temple, and himself cast out from the multitude of them that were of the captivity. 
\p
\v 5 And in three days were all they of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem: this was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. 
\v 6 And all the multitude sat together trembling in the broad place before the temple because of the present foul weather. 
\v 7 So Ezra arose up and said unto them, ye have transgressed the law and married strange wives, \add thereby\add* to increase the sins of Israel. 
\v 8 And now make confession and give glory unto the Lord, the God of our fathers, 
\v 9 and do his will, and separate yourselves from the heathen of the land, and from the strange women. 
\v 10 Then cried the whole multitude, and said with a loud voice, Like as thou hast spoken, so will we do. 
\v 11 But forasmuch as the multitude is great, and it is foul weather, so that we cannot stand without, and this is not a work of one day or two, seeing our sin in these things is spread far: 
\v 12 therefore let the rulers of the multitude stay, and let all them of our habitations that have strange wives come at the time appointed, 
\v 13 and with them the rulers and judges of every place, till we turn away the wrath of the Lord from us for this matter. 
\v 14  \add Then\add* Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah accordingly took the matter upon them: and Meshullam and Levi and Shabbethai were assessors to them. 
\v 15 And they that were of the captivity did according to all these things. 
\p
\v 16 And Ezra the priest chose unto him principal men of their families, all by name: and on the new moon of the tenth month they were shut in together to examine the matter. 
\v 17 So their cause that held strange wives was brought to an end by the new moon of the first month. 
\v 18 And of the priests that were come together, and had strange wives, there were found; 
\v 19 of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren: Maaseiah, and Eleazar, and Jarib, and Jodan. 
\v 20 And they gave their hands to put away their wives, and \add to offer\add* rams to make reconcilement for their error. 
\v 21 And of the sons of Immer: Hanani, and Zebadiah, and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Azariah. 
\v 22 And of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, and Nethanael, and Gedaliah, and Salthas. 
\v 23 And of the Levites: Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, who was called Kelita, and Pethahiah, and Judah, and Jonah. 
\v 24 Of the holy singers: Eliashib, Zaccur. 
\v 25 Of the porters: Shallum, and Telem. 
\v 26 Of Israel: of the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, and Izziah, and Malchijah, and Mijamin, and Eleazar, and Asibias, and Benaiah. 
\v 27 Of the sons of Ela: Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jezrielus, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Elijah. 
\v 28 And of the sons of Zamoth; Eliadas, Eliashib, Othoniah, Jeremoth, and Zadab, and Zerdaiah. 
\v 29 Of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, and Hananiah, and Zabbai, and Emathis. 
\v 30 Of the sons of Mani: Olamus, Mamuchus, Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Jeremoth. 
\v 31 And of the sons of Addi: Naathus, and Moossias, Laccunus, and Naidus, and Bescaspasmys, and Sesthel, Belnuus, and Manasseas. 
\v 32 And of the sons of Annan: Elionas, and Asaias, and Melchias, and Sabbaias, and Simon Chosamaeus. 
\v 33 And of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, and Mattattah, and Eliphelet, and Manasseh, and Shimei. 
\v 34 And of the sons of Bani: Jeremai, Momdius, Maerus, Joel, Mamdai, and Bedeiah, and Vaniah, Carabasion, and Eliashib, and Mamitanemus, Eliasis, Binnui, Elialis, Shimei, Shelemiah, Nethaniah: and of the sons of Ezora: Shashai, Azarel, Azael, Samatus, Zambris, Joseph. 
\v 35 And of the sons of Nooma: Mazitias, Zabad, Iddo, Joel, Benaiah. 
\v 36 All these had taken strange wives, and they put them away with their children. 
\v 37 And the priests and Levites, and they that were of Israel, dwelt in Jerusalem, and in the country, on the new moon of the seventh month, and the children of Israel in their habitations. 
\p
\v 38 And the whole multitude were gathered together with one accord into the broad place before the porch of the temple toward the east: 
\v 39 and they said unto Ezra the priest and reader, Bring the law of Moses, that was given of the Lord, the God of Israel. 
\v 40 So Ezra the chief priest brought the law unto the whole multitude both of men and women, and to all the priests, to hear the law on the new moon of the seventh month. 
\v 41 And he read in the broad place before the porch of the temple from morning unto midday, before both men and women; and all the multitude gave heed unto the law. 
\v 42 And Ezra the priest and reader of the law stood up upon the pulpit of wood, which was made \add for that purpose.\add* 
\v 43 And there stood up by him Mattathiah, Shema, Ananias, Azariah, Uriah, Hezekiah, Baalsamus, upon the right hand: 
\v 44 and upon his left hand, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Lothasubus, Nabariah, Zechariah. 
\v 45 Then took Ezra the book of the law before the multitude, and sat honorably in the first place before all. 
\v 46 And when he opened the law, they stood all straight up. So Ezra blessed the Lord God Most High, the God of Sabaoth, Almighty. 
\v 47 And all the people answered, Amen; and lifting up their hands they fell to the ground, and worshiped the Lord. 
\v 48 Also Jeshua, Anniuth, Sherebiah, Jadinus, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maiannas, and Kelita, Azariah, and Jozabad, and Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites, taught the law of the Lord, and read to the multitude the law of the Lord, making them withal to understand it. 
\v 49 Then said Attharates unto Ezra the chief priest and reader, and to the Levites that taught the multitude, even to all, 
\v 50 This day is holy unto the Lord; (now they all wept when they heard the law:) 
\v 51 go then, and eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them that have nothing; 
\v 52 for the day is holy unto the Lord: and be not sorrowful; for the Lord will bring you to honor. 
\v 53 So the Levites published all things to the people, saying, This day is holy; be not sorrowful. 
\v 54 Then went they their way, every one to eat and drink, and make merry, and to give portions to them that had nothing, and to make great cheer; 
\v 55 because they understood the words wherein they were instructed, and for which they had been assembled.
